I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:00:40]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomorrow&#8217;s a big day. It marks the beginning of what is called the RC period, or release candidate period, for the current major release of the WordPress CMS. If you&#8217;re not super familiar with the way release cycles work, this is the point in the process where the code should pretty much be done changing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That way you can call in your designers, developers, and anyone else who builds things for others using your software. And they can either start testing their products on it, or they can figure out what new things they need to be able to teach their clients, whichever is most relevant to them. That is generally true for WordPress as well, but in true open source fashion, there is a caveat built in that helps us to get in last-minute, vital changes from contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a two-person sign-off rule that&#8217;s been around for about as long as I can remember, but lets things be added late in the release cycle, as long as there are two sign-offs from qualified contributors. Most of the time, those qualified contributors are lead developers of the project, but not always. We have a good group of people who are around helping us make sure that this is doable and the best thing that we can offer to all of our users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:50]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, yeah, two-person sign-off, that is the little bit of release process trivia that you never knew you needed. And since we&#8217;re looking at a release trivia, kind of hidden bits of how software is made, I actually have a guest with me today, Channing Ritter. So Channing is a product and visual designer based in Brooklyn, New York.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She&#8217;s a design director at Automattic and has been working on the WordPress project as a full-time sponsored contributor since January, 2021. She is joining us to share some behind the scenes intel on what&#8217;s going into the 6.0 release, her role in that process, and then we&#8217;ll just kind of see how the conversation goes from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:40]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, and with that, I&#8217;d like to welcome Channing to the WordPress Briefing. Hi Channing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter </strong>00:02:45]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey Josepha. Thanks so much for having me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:02:48] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m excited to have you here. If I understand, you are working on the design side of things with the release. So why don&#8217;t you tell me a little bit about the role you&#8217;ve played?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:02:59] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am. I am the design release lead for the 6.0 release. And if I understand correctly, this is a position that has been unfulfilled for the past few release cycles. So I&#8217;m kind of the first person to step in over the past few releases. And I think that&#8217;s really exciting, especially because design has started to play such a more important role in the WordPress project over the past few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it makes sense that design would have a seat at the table, and I&#8217;m really excited to be helping advocate for the design team and learning from other folks on the release squad. Who&#8217;ve been doing this for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:03:33] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. First big question about 6.0, what is the feature that you are most excited about?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:03:39] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m most excited about the style switcher within the global styles panel. Um, so if folks still don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about there, it&#8217;s the ability to change between different variations of the theme.json without actually switching the theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is a way to get a drastically different look and feels across your site with just a single click. And I see it as a really fun place to experiment and kind of get inspired for the different ways your site could appear without ever having to change your theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in terms of the Twenty Twenty-Two variations, they&#8217;re just really gorgeous and all so diverse. Like you have the main default theme that has the deep green and kind of peachy colors and this really elegant type treatment with a really thin Serif typeface. But then the variations are so different from that. And I think my favorite one is the Swiss variation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:04:36]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Swiss variation?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:04:38]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, every graphic design nerd loves Swiss design.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:04:42] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, ok! Now I know!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:04:38] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Really awesome things found in there. It&#8217;s a really high contrast, bold variation. It&#8217;s kind of black and white with red accents. I just love how different it is from the default style and how easy it is to change up your site and just get a whole drastically different look and feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:05:00] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s excellent. So for folks who do not know what we&#8217;re referring to, when we talk about the Twenty Twenty-Two variation, that is the default theme, Twenty Twenty-Two. I&#8217;ll put a link to both the classic and block-based versions in our show notes, but you&#8217;ll want to use the block-based version to look at these style variations that Channing has mentioned here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:05:24] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we&#8217;re really excited that the first-ever default block theme was released with 5.9, which is when Twenty Twenty-Two first went out and was bundled with 5.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, with 6.0, I think even more so it&#8217;s starting to showcase the real power of block themes and what can actually be done there. And style variations is a huge kind of first step into this new world of block themes and starting to really open up the possibilities and all the flexibility that you have there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:05:55] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, absolutely. So when we&#8217;re talking about the Twenty Twenty-Two default theme, when we&#8217;re talking about switching these variations inside the theme itself, that seems to me to be a very user-focused kind of feature. And when we talk about users in WordPress, there&#8217;s a lot of room for interpretation. Like if we look at it kind of in a framework of three types of users of WordPress, you have, like end-users. So people who are site owners using it as a site to, like, enable their business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you also have mid-end users—people who use it to build sites for others. And what I like to call back-end users, people who are using WordPress as a framework. And of course at the start of the Gutenberg project, way back in forever, a million years ago, one of the big calls to action that we had around even, like, trying to do this, was that we wanted to make WordPress easier for users. Just plain users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and to me, that means making WordPress easier for those mid-end users, people who are creating WordPress sites for other people. But also should give some power and autonomy back to those end-users, the people who are using sites to enable their business or are site owners.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:07:14] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so in that context, between 5.9 and 6.0, do you feel like we have features that are really giving that kind of power and agency back to our end-users? Do you feel like we have some features that are really focused on those mid-end users, as opposed to our backend users? For a long time, we focused heavily on enabling our backend users, and now Gutenberg kind of moves us into those other two areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so do you think that things like being able to switch between your style of variations, other things like that are moving us closer to that particular goal of Gutenberg?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:07:51] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a great question. I think it&#8217;s both. I think some of the features being released in 6.0 are absolutely going to empower that end-user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Particularly in terms of improvements around design tools and some of the quality of life improvements. For example, partially selecting across multiple blocks and being able to partially select texts there. That&#8217;s the type of thing that really brings the writing experience in the editor to be on par with how you would expect a text editing experience to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there are tons of small quality of life improvements in this release that I think are really gonna help those end-users. But there are also improvements around what we might call the maintainers who are building sites for others. I think block locking in particular is something that is really going to start filling a gap between people who build the sites and then people who do the day-to-day maintenance within a site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in 6.0, we&#8217;re introducing some interface UI around block locking, but also there&#8217;ll be control around the ability to lock user roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:09:03]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which I think makes a lot of sense. I mean, we have all of these user roles in the CMS itself, and for a long time, we&#8217;ve just been like free for all on blocks, which was great and is great and should be available to people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also if we are saying, like, it makes sense to have this gradient of users and their abilities for the CMS itself, and we are saying that we want to move control of the website and the content to be at the base layer in these blocks, then it also makes sense that we should be able to provide that same sort of granular level of access in the blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think that&#8217;s a great thing. If you all, if dear listeners, you do not know what we mean by “block locking,” I&#8217;m sure that I can find a link for us in our show notes below as well. If for anyone who&#8217;s been talking through Gutenberg things with me for a while, you know that this is one of the primary use cases that I think has been a long time coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:10:05]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was one of the first examples that I offered to folks when we had that question of like, who is this being built for? In what way is this beneficial to that mid-end user, as opposed to just giving all of the power and autonomy to users in a way that maybe is not the best for their visitors?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of those use cases that made the most sense to me being able to say, okay, well, the opportunity to, as somebody who runs an agency and is building websites for people to be able to say, yeah, ‘You can do anything that is possible in this instance of WordPress and all the things that you are allowed to do will not break your instance. It won&#8217;t break your website’.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it gives a lot of time back to agencies to focus on their client&#8217;s most important problems, as opposed to not knowing how to update the hours in their footer or something like that. And so I&#8217;m very excited about that particular feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:11:01]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s such a long-requested feature. I mean, we&#8217;ve been hearing requests around this particular feature for years and, you know, often when something gets requested over a span of years like that, it&#8217;s because there are some complexities to figure out how it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s definitely been the case with moving forward with block locking. And there are a lot of nuances there. But I think what you were saying, I totally agree with. There’s always a push and pull. And as we enable more and more flexibility for end-users, there needs to be a little bit of push from the other side to kind of give more granular controls, more locking options, and make sure that everything can still be easily maintained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:11:43]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, we mentioned in that answer the concept of maintainers. If you are a contributor, it&#8217;s not <em>that</em> kind of ‘maintainer.’ So if you&#8217;re a WordPress contributor and we said maintainers there, um, just know that that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re referring to. If you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about when I say ‘contributor,’ there is a whole community of open source people and maintainers are people who specifically take care of a particular part of the WordPress software or the WordPress project, um, that makes all this possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s, ya know….&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:12:19] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So true! The maintainer has another meaning in this context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:12:20]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, we have a mix in our audience and I love it, but it also makes me frequently spend like 10% of my podcast being like, by the way, when I said this, I didn&#8217;t mean you, but I did mean <em>you</em>, which makes it harder. I know.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. You’ve been with the project for a little bit, but if I recall correctly, this is the first time that you were, like, leading part of a release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what would you say was the most challenging part of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong>  00:12:52] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great question. This is my first time being this closely involved with the release. Although I was involved with the 5.9 release, but mostly in a release assets capacity. So I helped with the <em>About Page</em> and the welcome banner that goes on the dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I did get some insight in the last release cycle. Which was great preparation for being more involved as a release lead on this cycle. From the design perspective, one of the hardest things is always going to be figuring out what exactly goes into the release and what needs more time. In the sense, you know, that there might be some features that need to stay in the Gutenberg plugin for a while and get more testing before they get released to a much wider audience in a major WordPress release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think on the design side, we definitely have some goals that are big, long-term projects that are likely going to span across, you know, many releases, maybe even over many years. And I think the full site editor is a great example of that in a sense that it&#8217;s not something that you just were gone in one release and then it all gets released and then it&#8217;s all good to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong>  00:14:06] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s something that has to be staggered across many releases, and there&#8217;s a lot of thought that goes into it; does this make sense in this more limited capacity, and what else needs to go in in order for this feature to go in? And the most complex things about the WordPress project is how interconnected things are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you start making those decisions about what should go in, what should get pulled out, often there&#8217;s sort of a domino effect of like, well, that would affect this feature and then, well, maybe they shouldn&#8217;t go in, or maybe this does need to go in. And that is really one of the most challenging, but also one of the most fascinating aspects of the release process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:14:46] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. It is very, very true that there are kind of no small problems left in WordPress. *laughs* Yeah, when we, when we first started with this like bigger release squad, cause that has not been routine for the history of the project. When we first started with that, I know that expanding out the exposure to like how much one change affects 25 different things was really, it was really good for all of us to be reminded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I mentioned at the top of our episode today, tomorrow begins the RC period. It begins the release candidate period, which is when it&#8217;s supposed to be, as locked down as possible. But if you all have been following along with our release process in general, which if you&#8217;re listening to this, you probably have, you know that last week or a couple of weeks ago, we had this whole question about the Webfonts API, and we had that conversation in a public space as best we could,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, there are always things that you can&#8217;t, like, fully disclose in public spaces, but we had a very open and transparent conversation about, like, who is most affected by putting it in, in the state that the API was in. And, who&#8217;s most affected if we take it out. And where can we make compromises on either side so that both sides are a little happy and a little unhappy?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:16:09] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, like, that is all so hard to do. Not only in general. We have a 20-year-old code base and a five-year-old code base. And it&#8217;s all a big, big undertaking to understand what is happening and where it happens. And so there&#8217;s this moment always when we are trying to decide, like, is this baked enough? Did we put it in too early? Should we pull it out? How, if we pull it out, did we ask people to do too much work before we decided to pull it out anyway?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, you always have those kinds of questions about it. And honestly, I think that most of us weren&#8217;t around the last time, that WordPress was, was this experimental in public, like it&#8217;s always been open source. It&#8217;s always been experimental and iterating publicly, which is just the hardest way to work on anything. We like, we shipped our best guesses. Don&#8217;t be mad. It&#8217;ll be… we&#8217;re coming for it. We&#8217;re going to fix it. Like, that&#8217;s always hard, but the last time around, when it was this substantial a change was, like, 2008 or something, like, it was ages and ages ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong>  00:17:14] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we were smaller than, we had a smaller number of contributors. We had a smaller group of people actually using the CMS. And so over time it has gotten more and more complicated. And, and I don&#8217;t think that we can ever understate the complexities of that. And so for you, you had a little bit of exposure to it in 5.9 and then showed up for like really doing it in 6.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Has it been a surprising change? Like, were you surprised much more by how complicated it was when you were closer to it?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:17:47] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, definitely. It’s been a real learning process, especially coming to understand how much there really are no easy answers. I think a lot of us are in the release squad are real problem solver types of people and, and want it to, you know, be a really neat, tidy answer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s not always the case. You know, sometimes parts of the feature might go in, or some contingency plan might get put into place and things didn&#8217;t go exactly as planned. But what you said of being an experiment and being on kind of the cutting edge of trying out new things, I think there is a lot of passion around that in the WordPress project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, we&#8217;re in such a transitional period for the project, you know, moving from classic themes to block themes and really changing the ideas of how we approach designing sites. And because of that, I think there is a lot of momentum and energy around getting new features, as many new features as possible into each release. But there&#8217;s also, you know, a lot of testing and stuff that needs to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to make sure that, like you said, these things aren&#8217;t going out too early.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:19:01] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, and there&#8217;s always that difficulty, we&#8217;re going to just leap right into open source areas now. There&#8217;s always that difficulty around, like, there&#8217;s this concept that when, like, we always want to ship something that doesn&#8217;t break backward compatibility when possible, we don&#8217;t want to ship vulnerabilities. Like, that&#8217;s always true, but we are in an open source project, and open source projects are necessarily kind of tolerant of like, that&#8217;s not our best, but like it skates, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was, we aimed for Ferrari and got a skateboard because sometimes you got to start with a skateboard, right? *laughter* Like if it gets you from one place to another, that&#8217;s kind of where we&#8217;ve got to aim some days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:19:45] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Totally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong>  00:19:46] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s always so, so difficult, especially cause, like, for the big change that 5.0 represented, and that 5.9 represented– 6.0 is not as big a shock as 5.9 was.&nbsp; But, like, as big a change as those represented, it still skates. And that&#8217;s, I think what makes the work especially hard, especially nuanced. And like, we haven&#8217;t gotten together as human beings in two years. And so sometimes people just kind of forget there&#8217;s a human being back there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re humans. Everyone be nice. Yeah. I don&#8217;t know that part of running a release definitely was surprising to me. My first release that I ran was 5.0 and…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:20:31] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, wow!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:20:32]</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Yeah, it was, like, that was  2018. And then I became the executive director at the top of 2019. And I distinctly remember one core chat where I showed up and just was like the most transparent, vulnerable person we&#8217;ve ever experienced in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not true. We have very vulnerable people in the project and very transparent people, but I told everyone like, there are a million of you and one of me, and it&#8217;s kind of terrifying that you&#8217;re leaping on me in this—like you&#8217;re scaring me a lot right now. And that was quite a thing to say to like, all these… it&#8217;s terrifying! Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:21:12] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love when you see that type of vulnerability in the project. I think it takes… it takes a degree of comfort and familiarity with the project to even be able to admit to that. And to me, that&#8217;s a real sign of growth in the project. Like when I first started contributing, I don&#8217;t think I ever would have just said, like, ‘How is the feature supposed to work? I have no idea.’ That&#8217;s something that I say all the time now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>*Laughter*</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know, that is completely fine and more than okay. It&#8217;s a massive project. There are folks who have done deep thinking about a feature over the course of years. You know, and there are experts who can help shed light on various problems that maybe you just haven&#8217;t had a chance to dive into yet and really understand the nuances of yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the amazing thing about open source is that you can lean on folks who do have expertise in that particular area. You&#8217;re not expected to be an expert-expert in every single domain. It&#8217;s okay to say, I don&#8217;t really have a good idea or a good concept of this feature. I don&#8217;t have a good feeling for it. What do other folks think?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:22:24] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even people who have been in the project for a long time, decade plus, still say that all the time. You know, or you might just say, like, I have a really rough idea of how this works, are other people seeing this the same way? Or did other people have a different, you know, mental picture of how this might work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if, sometimes it feels like you&#8217;re over-communicating, it&#8217;s really helpful because often people do have really dramatically different ideas about how a feature might take shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:22:49] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I hope that&#8217;s one of the things that we never lose in the project. Like we are an old, old project now and we support a bunch of the web with a tiny, tiny group of people compared to the amount of the web that we support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I hope that we always have that opportunity as senior leaders, which I am, and all of our upcoming leaders to all of us, just at some point, be like, can we stop the train? I don&#8217;t understand. I don’t understand that. Um, and not necessarily feel that that has made us a worse contributor. Cause I think that it&#8217;s when we are transparent about our lack of understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s when we have the opportunity to make what we&#8217;re offering to the world more solid and always better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:23:35] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it. I think it&#8217;s the, one of the most lovely things about the WordPress community. There&#8217;s really low judgment around those types of questions and people are really inclusive and more than happy to take a moment to explain something to you or shed some light on an issue you might not have thought that much about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s one of the best things you can always reach out for help. And folks are always willing to provide guidance or context or even historical information about, you know, whether it&#8217;s been tried in the past or previous explorations and that sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:24:10] </p>\n\n\n\n<p> All right. Well, that covers all of my questions for you. Do you have a final thought about the release that you would like to share with everyone you don&#8217;t have to, if you don&#8217;t want to, not everyone has like a final sign off.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:24:25] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. One of the things I&#8217;m most excited about for this 6.0 release is all of the improvements around design tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And these are just small improvements around a ton of different things, like the color panel, border controls, gap support, typography options, flexible container blocks, etc. These are the types of tools that are a designer&#8217;s dream. You know, they really make the difference between being able to make a really crisp, finished looking final product and having something that&#8217;s a little rough around the edges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a designer, like those are the things that your eye goes straight towards. And all of these nuanced new tools, they really allow designers to have that fine detailed control to create really pixel perfect sites. And I think that&#8217;s something that, you know, myself and a lot of others on the design team are just so beyond excited about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:25:25]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. Well, Channing, thank you so much for joining us today on the WordPress Briefing; it has been an absolute delight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:25:32] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:25:41] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it is time, woohoo, for the small list of big things. My favorite part of this podcast, that&#8217;s not true. I have a lot of things that I love about this podcast. I just, in particular love being able to share like three things that are coming up in the next couple of weeks that everybody should be aware of. And I really particularly like the list I have this week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First as of today, we are two weeks away from WordSesh. If you&#8217;re looking forward to your first in-person WordPress event, but feel like you could use a little foundation information, a little bit of a WordPress primer, then this event has a lot of excellent thought leaders in the project that you can learn from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for more practical or hands-on opportunities, uh, you can also check out social learning spaces. All of those are free for anyone. So I will include links to both of them in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:26:30]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, as of today, we are four weeks away from WordCamp Europe. This is one of our flagship events. So it also includes a contributor day, which I encourage you to look into. If you have never heard of one before. I will be there to meet some of the contributors that have joined the project since the end of 2019. And hopefully, I will see you there as well. If you&#8217;ve never heard of a contributor day, then I&#8217;ll include a link to the beginner&#8217;s guide to contributions, a little talk that I gave in 2017 in the show notes that should help you get your bearings or at the very least know what questions to ask yourself to figure out if a contributor day is right for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing as of today, it has been one week since <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/iandunn/\">Ian Dunn</a> and the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/\">Meta</a> developers… Um, that sounds like a band… Ian Dunn and the Meta developers connected the props channel in the community Slack to WordPress.org profile activity. I&#8217;m really excited about this. It&#8217;s the first in a long list of changes that are part of a larger project to credit more non-code contributions, more contributions that are not specific to a major release or event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also to set us up to be able to provide more quality checks and balances for our growing Five for the Future program. If you&#8217;ve not been over there lately, if you&#8217;re not super sure what I&#8217;m talking about, there&#8217;s a link to the discussion post that we had about it, but also you can wander right over into the Making WordPress Slack and check out the props channel to just kind of see a running list of contributors that people are really grateful for. Which, frankly, if you ever are having a bad day, that is a wonderful place to just kind of wander in and see all of the positive vibes that people are sending around to each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, yeah, so the props channel, is always good. Uh, and that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12742\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"People of WordPress: Meher Bala\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/04/people-of-wordpress-meher-bala/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 30 Apr 2022 09:20:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:7:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Interviews\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"HeroPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"People of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"WordCamp Mumbai\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:6;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16:\"wptranslationday\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12706\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"This month\'s People of WordPress feature shares the story of developer and e-commerce builder Meher Bala. \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"webcommsat AbhaNonStopNewsUK\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16637:\"\n<p>In this series, we share some of the inspiring stories of how WordPress and its global network of contributors can change people’s lives for the better.

From using the software as a basic website tool to helping entrepreneurs and good causes around the world fulfill their aspirations, she has overcome personal barriers and now aims to inspire others.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher found her vocation and learned new skills through WordPress. She also discovered a way to encourage other women to consider careers in IT.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Opening the doors to a career in technology</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a child, Meher was diagnosed with dyslexia (difficulty in reading the written word) and dyscalculia (difficulty in comprehending numbers and mathematical functions). With the support of her parents and a tutor, she was able to overcome this learning obstacle. She developed coping techniques and a determination to work to overcome challenges as they appeared later in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In school, she got an opportunity to replace one subject with computer studies as an alternative. This proved to be an eye-opener to future career possibilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She began to research not only what the internet had to offer but also how it worked, including the new and fascinating concepts of email and websites. Her father bought the family’s first desktop computer so she could do her research at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher’s father wanted to turn her love for computers into something that would serve her well in the future. In 2005, he enrolled her in a short computer course from a global IT training provider. The course tutor was so impressed with her performance, she was advised to enroll in a four year software development course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That meant she had studied the software development course alongside her higher education college course. Looking back, she enjoyed the dual challenge of the degree course in commerce, and the experience prepared her well to keep learning software while working as a developer. Within three years, she had learned C#, C, C++, HTML, Java, and .NET. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After graduation, she was in a dilemma to choose between commerce and IT. What to choose? She had a compulsory one-year technology internship to complete, and her choice of focus for that year would prove to be a defining moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2009, on her birthday, Meher was offered an internship. On the first day of the internship, she was introduced to WordPress. Her initial assignment was to change the look and feel of the WordPress dashboard — in just six hours. But there was a problem &#8211; she had never worked with WordPress before!</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;I stared at the whiteboard and thought that task given was impossible and difficult to meet the deadline. I wondered if my boss was joking and did not know then what you could do with WordPress as a developer and how it could slot into your toolbox. It opened my eyes.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><cite>Meher Bala</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher used her research skills to know more about using WordPress. She found a plugin that would help her achieve her task. She met the deadline and it ingrained an interest that she would never lose. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Re-discovering WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Five years after her initial WordPress experience, Meher was assigned to lead an international project in WordPress.&nbsp;She was hesitant — she had lost touch with the CMS during that five years, but the project was a great opportunity to become a team leader and lead from the front.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She decided to update her WordPress skills, relying again on the strength of her research skills and determination. In the process, she also taught her team all about WordPress, inspiring many of those members to continue to develop their WordPress skill set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The success of that project was a pivotal moment for Meher and a new dawn as a developer specializing in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a team lead, Meher soon found it was not possible to always have all the answers straight away. She found internet searches gave practical solutions—but rarely explained the theory behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So she went looking for a WordPress group to help her expand the scope and depth of her knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding the community and its developer learning opportunities </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"999\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?resize=999%2C667&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Meher at WordCamp Nagpur in 2017\" class=\"wp-image-12762\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?w=999&amp;ssl=1 999w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Meher enjoying being part of <em>WordCamp Nagpur in 2017</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, while browsing Facebook, Meher came across an advertisement for something called WordCamp Mumbai, an event that had taken two days before. She did a little digging to learn what a WordCamp was, and about the people behind it. She took the plunge and joined the WordPress Mumbai Meetup group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her first Meetup experience was not love at first sight. She felt the topics were for advanced users, and the timing late in the evening made it difficult to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a few months later, the Meetup addressed a topic that could help her resolve an issue in one of her current projects. She made the effort to show up and came away with a number of important tips.&nbsp;The speaker had taken the time to speak to individual attendees. When he came to Meher, she took the opportunity to ask a couple of questions about her project issues. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thereafter she went to more Meetups and got to know the people behind this group, just as they started talking about WordCamp Mumbai 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A WordCamp adventure</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcm16.jpg?resize=600%2C800&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Meher pictured with the WordCamp Mumbai 2016 sign \" class=\"wp-image-12758\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcm16.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcm16.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Meher discovering <em>WordCamps in Mumbai in 2016</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher expressed interest in being a part of the coming&nbsp; WordCamp Mumbai and started in an entry-level role with basic responsibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, she thought WordCamp was a formal conference with about 100 people. So on the first day of WordCamp Mumbai 2016, she was surprised to see so many WordCamp enthusiasts attending and enjoying such a relaxed and friendly conference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that great experience, Meher went to many more meetups and did more volunteering. She started taking on responsibilities in the coming WordCamps and getting to know the different aspects of the camp.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the following years, at each WordPress, she took up a new role like speaker vetting, sponsors, and volunteer coordination. This allowed her to know more about what an organizer needs to do, from planning to execution, to make WordCamp a successful event.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?resize=900%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WordCamp Mumbai 2017 group photo of the team\" class=\"wp-image-12765\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>With the team at <em>WordCamp Mumbai in 2017</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher is grateful for her WordPress journey which was fostered in the Mumbai community. It has been filled with beautiful surprises.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people ask why she’s chosen to specialize professionally in WordPress, Meher says WordPress is easy to teach a non-technical person, yet it is still highly customizable. Being a WordPress developer has given her the opportunity to work&nbsp; remotely for global web development companies that let her think out of the box. And she learns new skills with every release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The community makes WordPress special</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher says that some of her most memorable WordPress moments have revolved around special friendships, trying new things, and participating in community building.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has let her explore different parts of India, make new friends locally and internationally, and encourage women to be a part of meetup groups and events across India.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Meher’s biggest dreams was to lead WordCamp Mumbai as a lead organizer and show others what could be achieved by working together in open source. In 2019, she did just that and has volunteered at international WordCamps and meetups since.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"515\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=1024%2C515&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Meher speaking at WordCamp Mumbai 2019\" class=\"wp-image-12731\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=1024%2C515&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?w=1247&amp;ssl=1 1247w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Taking to the stage at WordCamp Mumbai in 2019</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of her enthusiasm for sharing the opportunities WordPress can give people, especially women, she has given time to co-organize two global <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">WordPress Translation month long events</a> and contributor events in India.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher said: “I was first introduced to translation at one of the meetups which was organised to support the WordPress Translation Day. I realized this was another way to support my local communities and bring the power of WordPress to them by contributing in Gujarati and Hindi. I did not imagine I would a few years later be a global organizer for the event itself!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With her commitment to ongoing learning as a developer and to model what she believes about the value and community growth opportunities of open source, Meher has given time and energy to the Marketing Team, where she has been a Team Rep, to the Training Team, and to the Core Team contributing to multiple releases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The developer adventure with WordPress is unlimited</h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>At the start of my software developer journey, I always thought the C++ and Java were the only skills you required to excel in your career. From the time I started exploring WordPress in depth, I realized the potential and the power of WordPress in web development.</p><cite>Meher Bala</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a part of the WordPress community, Meher learned that there is so much more than just building blogs on WordPress. She started exploring different features of WordPress, created her first theme, and eventually specialized as a frontend specialist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher now works as a consultant and front end developer with an international agency specializing in WordPress. Asked what she thought was the best thing about being a WordPress developer, Meher replied: &#8220;Through WordPress, I have an opportunity to build unique out of the box websites and work&nbsp;remotely for global web development companies that encourages you to think out of the box. There is always opportunity to continuously advance my coding skills and learn new techniques with every release.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She believes that there is no limit to where using the software can take you and what you can combine it with to find solutions to projects big and small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you earn a living from WordPress, her advice is from the heart: try to give back to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I am sure you will learn or teach something new and definitely make friends across the world. There is no shame in making mistakes, as you can learn from them and develop your skills further. You can also help others as they build their skills.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher added: “Don’t let the things you find difficult get in the way of your success.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"share-the-stories\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>), Larissa Murillo (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lmurillom</a>), Mary Baum (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a>), Chloé Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>), and Meg Phillips (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/megphillips91/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>megphillips91</a>) for interviews, writing and image work on this story.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:00:39] </strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So you&#8217;ve been listening to this podcast for a while. You may be one of these contributors I keep mentioning; you may be an agency owner or freelancer. Maybe you&#8217;ve wondered how to make a WordPress blog for your big idea. Or, maybe you&#8217;re one of the many people who use WordPress for their project or business. Before WordPress was known as a content management system, as a way to get sites online fast, it was a blogging tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have long since outgrown that, but even 19 years into our journey, blogging is still a key part of what WordPress enables you to do. That&#8217;s because even after those 19 years, the mission of WordPress is still the same. And that is to democratize publishing, to help people have a place online where they can tell their stories or share their projects or set up their businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever tried to set up a blog, you know that there isn&#8217;t a lot of information about what to know before you get going at all. So I&#8217;m going to talk about that a little bit today. And just by the way, if you heard the word blog right now and thought, oh, Josepha, how old fashioned? I think it&#8217;s important to remember that there&#8217;s a business advantage to having well-written, relevant content on your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re not blogging for business, because not all of us are, then the benefits are a little different but still important to my mind. Things like the cathartic benefits of journaling, a chance to build community, and the general importance of preserving wisdom for the ages. Anyway, back to the topic at hand. Before we can get to any of the fancy things that WordPress can do nowadays, it&#8217;s important to know a few things as you get ready to set up your first ever website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s dive in. Here is how you need to get yourself started. First, have an idea and a plan. So have an idea for what you&#8217;re doing, the concept of your content, who you want to reach, and some concept of a domain name. I would encourage you to not necessarily get your heart set on a domain name at first. Cause, like, if you want the domain name, wordpress.org, like we own that, you can have that! But if you know that you want a domain like WordPressbloggingforthefuture.com, like that one might be more available. And if you know the kind of words you want in your domain, you can be a bit flexible about what is there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:09]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that you need to do is that if you are just getting started, ask yourself the question, what sort of host do I want? We kind of mentioned all along the WordPress process that, like, you need a good host, but it’s not always clear where that decision has to happen. It happens right here at the start, before you even know what WordPress is most of the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the earliest question that you have to answer for yourself is what sort of host do I want? Where do I want my site to live? So ask yourself how much you want to get into the maintenance and configuration of your website and the hardware that it lives on versus creating content or keeping your shop up to date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this whole spectrum of hosting options, and they range from full service where they will keep your WordPress software up to date, provide daily backups, and have customer support if something goes really wrong. So it ranges all the way from full service like that all the way down to essentially zero services, just kind of hands-off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:11]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>They give you a space to keep your WordPress software, to keep your WordPress site. But they leave everything else up to you. They leave the backups up to you. They leave updating up to you, things like. So that&#8217;s the first thing you have to ask yourself. And the first question you have to be able to answer. Most of the time, you will want to start with one of the full-service options. That way, you know that your software is set up correctly and safely from the start. And as you learn more about the software and what you want and what you need, and you have the ability to learn in the time that you have, the more that you can add on either service with the existing hosts that you chose or moving to a different host; however that works out for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if that one sounds like the right option, then you choose a host, go to their site, and actually most of them will have a way to walk you through how to set up a WordPress site inside their system. Most of the time, it&#8217;s just one click and then they ask you some questions to get some configurations right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:10]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other option that on the like zero, zero service side, that&#8217;s not quite fair, but you know, the other side of that spectrum that probably will be appealing to you if you are already familiar with code or already know how to manage a server or, or you know how to work in this thing called c-panel, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you already have a lot of information on how all of that works, you can, if you want to, head over to wordpress.org/download, and you can download a zip file of the WordPress software and set that up in your own environment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, quick check here. If this all sounds roughly doable to you, or at least it feels like we&#8217;re in the right starting point, but you find yourself thinking, gosh, I just wish she would slow down a little.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got you covered. In the show notes, you&#8217;ll find a link to one of the Learn WP courses for getting started with WordPress. There&#8217;s a section on choosing a host as well as various other early steps of this process. So if you felt like I blazed through all of that, which honestly I kind of did, you can work through those lessons in that course, at your own pace, and it&#8217;s, and it&#8217;s really a very good guide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Let&#8217;s pretend we did all of that. Now you&#8217;ve got yourself a website. The thing that you will want to do next, or rather the first thing that you&#8217;ll notice once you get your site up and running, is that there&#8217;s this ‘Hello World’ post– there&#8217;s a post that already exists in there. The Hello World post is a placeholder for the common features of a blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There, you can find your featured image, your title, your content, and even some fake comments. You can either edit this post so that you can see how your writing will look from the start, and you can kind of compare like, okay, the Hello World part over here on this page, exists in this field over here on this page. So you can kind of see where everything works, how it all looks together. Or, if you&#8217;re more familiar with WordPress or CMS in general, you can simply remove that and start fresh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:07:17]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;ve got now a website, we know, kind of, how to look at our posts and create posts, where comments are, where they can kind of be moderated and stuff. And so, the most fun task for everyone is choosing a theme. But if it&#8217;s not a fun task, if it doesn&#8217;t sound like a fun task to you, I can help you kind of do some, choose your own adventure guiding questions here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, you can ask yourself how you want the site to look. Do you want it to mostly be a lot of photos or entirely words, mostly animations? You can head to the theme directory and search for a theme with most of the features that you want. There&#8217;s like a filtering system where you can put in, like, you want three columns so that you can have three columns of text if you want it to look kind of like an old school newspaper kind of layout and things like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:08:12]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a way to look for themes inside your instance, your WordPress site, but like, if you haven&#8217;t set that up yet, but you do still want to see kind of what your theme options are, you can go to wordpress.org/themes and and take a look at what&#8217;s out there. Just as a quick side note, if you get to that theme directory, if you get to wordpress.org/themes, and it feels overwhelming, which I can understand, I recommend starting with a theme that is designed for blogging specifically so that you can see how things look right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s actually a theme that does come with every WordPress site. So if you&#8217;re not ready, you can skip this thing entirely and just work with the theme that&#8217;s already there. Every word, press instance ships with a theme and it is fully functional when you, when you get your site up and running. So you don&#8217;t need to choose a theme right now if you don&#8217;t feel ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the other very fun thing that people do with their WordPress sites is to add plugins to them. So plugins are these little pieces of software that you add on to the WordPress software that lets it do additional things. It adds additional functionality. The questions that you can ask to kind of guide yourself through what sorts of plugins you might want, what sorts of functionality you might want to add to your site are a little similar to the ones that you want to ask for figuring out which theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:09:36]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So figure out if there are tasks that you need visitors to do. Do you need them to contact you? Do you want them to watch a video? Should they review and respond to questions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a concept of the things that you want users to do on your website, then you can head to the plugin directory and search for a plugin with features that you need. Also, there are just endless lists of recommended plugins out there; if that is something that you find valuable as part of your research, those are also easy to find.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a general side note here, there are even more plugins than there are themes. So if you have gotten to this point and feel like you don&#8217;t quite know the answers to the questions that I shared, and, and it&#8217;s going to be a while until you feel like you can know what those answers are. That&#8217;s totally fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll tell you this. I have never seen a site without a contact form. So feel free to begin your journey there. There are a lot of great plugins for contact forms and it can kind of help you figure out how to work with plugins in that way. So yeah, I made it sound like you can get a WordPress website built in like seven minutes and on the one hand you definitely can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:09:36]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on the other hand, it&#8217;s still a little bit more complicated. So here I have a final note for everyone. You will hear around the WordPress ecosystem. And obviously, here, are some things that could make you feel a little nervous about doing this for the first time. Things like the five-second installation, which WordPress has been famous for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also about how easy and simple it all is. And as somebody who was once in the position of learning WordPress for the first time, like I first encountered a WordPress site in 2009 and I started learning how to use WordPress in 2010. So I can say with confidence that once you learn it, it&#8217;s easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are the easiest of the hard options for CMS. Like content management systems are just complicated, but we are the easiest one out there. And so, as you&#8217;re learning, I want to just remind you to celebrate your small wins along the way. If you feel like you&#8217;re late to this blogging game, like you should have had a website for years. I mean, sure that could be true. And yes, the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. But the second-best time to plant that tree is today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress didn&#8217;t start out powering over 40% of the web, and your first site can&#8217;t be immediately measured in the millions of readers. So, what will your small beginning lead you to?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:12:25]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now that brings us to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one, the next release of WordPress, WordPress 6.0, has reached its beta phase. That means the full focus is on finding and fixing the bugs we accidentally created during this development cycle. Beta two comes out tomorrow and you can follow along in the core channel in the Making WordPress Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve never seen how those releases get packaged, and if you just want to keep an eye on what everybody&#8217;s doing so that you can be the first to know, yeah, Making WordPress Slack is the way to go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on our small list is that speaking of WordPress 6.0, we had the public walk through a couple of weeks ago, which means that in a few weeks, I&#8217;ll do a WordPress 6.0 sneak peek. I&#8217;ll share some highlights of the release features and why I think they are super important for you to take a look. Sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:13:22]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final, big thing, if you are new to WordPress and this episode has you all fired up to start your blog, we have a bunch of contributors over on the Learn WP team that have just the thing for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can join the online social learning space called How to Make a WordPress Blog. It&#8217;s a free online event that will help you get started. I&#8217;ll link the information in the show notes below. And I&#8217;ll also share in the show notes, a list of WordPress Meetup groups, where you can find more opportunities to learn and get support from other people locally who are also doing things with WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you can also find a list in the dashboard of your newly installed WordPress blog you no doubt have after this podcast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12658\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"WordPress 6.0 Beta 1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/04/wordpress-6-0-beta-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 19:08:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12644\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WordPress 6.0 Beta 1 is now available for download and testing.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Dan Soschin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7809:\"\n<p>WordPress 6.0 Beta 1 is now available for download and testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This version of the WordPress software is under development</strong>. Please do not install, run, and test this version of WordPress on a production or mission-critical website. Instead, it is recommended that you test Beta 1 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test the WordPress 6.0 Beta 1 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Option 1: Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</li><li>Option 2: Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.0-beta1.zip\">beta version here (zip)</a>.</li><li>Option 3: Use WP-CLI to test: <code>wp core update --version=6.0-beta1</code>. <br><strong><em>Do not use this option if your filesystem is case-insensitive.</em></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The current target for the final release is May 24, 2022, which is about six weeks away.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional information on the full <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-0/\">6.0 release cycle is available</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-0/\">6.0-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks which will detail all upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Keep WordPress Bug Free – Help with Testing</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development. Testing is also a great way to contribute. If you have never tested a beta release before, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2022/04/12/help-wanted-test-wordpress-6-0/\">this detailed guide</a> will walk you through how to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing helps make sure that this and future releases of WordPress are as stable and issue-free as possible. And anyone can do it – especially great WordPress community members just like you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to know more about testing releases like this one? Read about the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/\">testing initiatives</a> that happen in Make Core. You can also join a <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/core-test/\">publicly-accessible channel</a> on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com\">Making WordPress Slack workspace</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think you have run into an issue, please report it to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. If you are comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, you can <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/newticket\">file one on WordPress Trac</a>.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing: the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was checking the list of upcoming events recently as part of just my regular work and saw that the call for organizers for WordCamp Asia is open. On the one hand, it made my heart skip a beat with excitement. That event is six years or so in the making. And on the other hand, it reminded me of February 10th, 2020, the day that Matt told me that we had to proactively cancel WordCamp Asia. That week was truly heartbreaking for me as well as I think the entire organizing team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it also, fortunately, was prescient. As I think back over the two years since then, I&#8217;m grateful for our community wranglers and deputies who have consistently hosted important discussions about how to return to in-person events safely. And with two of our major flagship events returning this year, I&#8217;m here to summarize, sort of, what the rules and guidelines are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But certainly I hope that you come away from this with an idea of what&#8217;s being done to keep everyone safe as we are best able.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:44]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, before we dig into specifics, I want to be clear upfront that the guidelines for COVID-aware events are mandatory, unless otherwise stated. For folks who&#8217;ve been attending WordPress events, or participating in the community for a long time, this is a change. As a program, we have always done our best to be flexible with guidelines so that we can prioritize local knowledge. But our responsibility is to the long-term success of this community and this program. So moving forward with in-person events that risk the health of our community members poses risks to the program itself. So with that in mind, let&#8217;s learn what we&#8217;re going to see at events for the rest of the.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:02:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For any WordPress event that is gathering more than 50 people, the new mandatory guidelines are:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number one, follow local laws and guidelines. If your area has suggested guidelines on top of the mandatory ones, follow those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, is if you are in a location where laws or guidelines require or permit venues to limit admission based on a person&#8217;s vaccination status and masking, then events can only happen in venues that are willing to provide staff to check for vaccination status at the door. And then also to remind participants to wear masks during the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing is if your area or venue legally cannot check vaccination status, your area must pass the in-person checklist, which I will link in the show notes below. But that in-person checklist has to be passed at the time of the application and then again at the time of the event. And in addition to that, the venue must be willing to provide staff who will remind participants to wear masks and check for temperature during the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers in these areas must be prepared to move online or cancel if the region fails the safety checklist, which again, will be linked in the show notes below. So those are the three things and they are pretty dense, but also I think allow for a fair amount of flexibility. There is also a tidy flow chart linked in the sidebar of make.wordpress.org/community that will help you to decide what sort of event your own area can support right now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those are the mandatory guidelines for WordPress events in general right now, but you probably also have a few specific questions. So I&#8217;ve got the three most common questions ready to go with answers from Angela Jin who helped me to kind of pull together the information for this particular podcast props to Angela. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:25]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, first question, anything specific to know about WordCamp Europe? WordCamp Europe will be following these guidelines as well. All attendees and participants are expected to wear a mask while they are at the event and catering will be offered outside so people can remove their masks to eat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second common question is how will these guidelines change as countries and local governments begin deescalating restrictions and safety measures? We should consider these guidelines to be subject to evolution based on what the team is hearing and seeing from the community. But right now we intend to keep these stricter guidelines in place until we see how the loosened rules play out elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then a third frequent question is what&#8217;s going to happen to all these online events?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community team will continue to support online events right now. So if your community doesn&#8217;t feel ready to have an in-person event, but still wants to kind of get everyone together that is still allowed, and still&nbsp; encouraged. And finally the community team will continue to keep a close eye on situations around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it becomes safe to do so, and your community is interested, they of course will be happy to chat with you about a WordCamp. There is an application that I will share the link to in the show notes below as well. In case that is something that your community is wanting to look into.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and I have a little postscript also. I know I was like finally, and now I&#8217;m doing a finally, finally. That&#8217;s what postscripts are about. P.S. If you have not stopped by the community team’s site or any of their meetings, they&#8217;ve been doing a really great job of keeping things moving through two years of unpredictable changes. If you are a community team member, I want to offer you a huge thanks. Thank you so much for helping us to stay aware and able to move forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are an organizer, pat yourself on the back. I want to thank you for pivoting with us, moving through online events, even though they are not at all the same as in-person events and certainly they don&#8217;t share the reasons that we get people together sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, if you are an end to end attendee, if you go to WordPress meetups or you go to any sort of WordPress online events or WordCamps, anything like that, thank your local organizer. They have been doing this probably for a while, and I&#8217;m sure that they are looking forward to getting back to in-person events themselves, but even, so they have been putting in a lot of volunteer hours to help make sure that we all know how to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so find them, thank them, and I&#8217;m sure that they&#8217;ll appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:07:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, it is time for our small list of big things. Number one, WordCamp Asia has a call for organizers open! This event will be in 2023. And I think that we all simply cannot wait. So I&#8217;ll link the call for organizers in the show notes. And then of course you can follow that whole site to stay up to date on what&#8217;s happening there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is, while we&#8217;re on the topic of events, there&#8217;s also an open discussion about how we can best support organizers who are getting back to in-person events. We&#8217;d like thoughts from both organizers and attendees. So feel free to drop by and leave a note in the comments section. And while you&#8217;re over there, the third thing in my small list of big things, there&#8217;s also an open discussion about regional events. So go over there, get all your thoughts about WordPress events together. Get them all sorted out in one go. Just leave comments, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. All over the place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:08:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my most embarrassing WordCamp story actually has to do with where I was supposed to be versus where people thought I was supposed to be. This was early on in my time with WordPress, with Automattic. And I had convinced someone, I had convinced a colleague and friend of mine to go to my home WordCamp, WordCamp Fayetteville over there in Arkansas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I didn&#8217;t go. But I knew I wasn&#8217;t going, I knew I was going to WordCamp Boston, but he did not know that I was not going to go. And so he arrived at WordCamp Fayetteville, WordCamp Northwest Arkansas. I can&#8217;t remember what it was called at the time. And immediately was confused about where I was and why I wasn&#8217;t there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there was this excellent moment of mass confusion among states where the folks at WordCamp Fayetteville started tweeting about how I had convinced this contributor to go to that event and then didn&#8217;t show up. And then the folks at WordCamp Boston, we&#8217;re looking at all of those tweets, because if you are a WordCamp organizer, you are always looking at the tweets from all the other WordCamps happening in your weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And people got very confused about why I was in Boston while they were thinking that I was in Fayetteville, even though the tweets were talking about how, like, I wasn&#8217;t in Fayetteville. They probably didn&#8217;t say that it was probably more along the lines of like, “Hey, let&#8217;s share a photo with Josepha” to, like, make fun of the fact that I wasn&#8217;t there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I caused mass confusion in multiple states.

For Juan Aldasoro, a developer and product manager for a large distributed company, it provides an opportunity to combine his different interests and skills to live the type of life he wanted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I like visual, creative and technical things. The joy of WordPress is that you can do all of these things, you don’t have to limit yourself to any one aspect . You can also do this from almost anywhere in the world!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From working in products since 2012, Juan sees WordPress as a major part of his skillset and toolbox. He said: “It gives you an opportunity to be part of building a product which could potentially be used by thousands of people and more on your site. It encourages you to think about different languages and how you can make it accessible. It allows you to work on different platforms. Working in WordPress gives you this broad approach. Working this way on products ended up pushing me into learning about all these different things. Only in open source can you really do this and use your creative side to find solutions.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Learning about being part of a community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"924\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813.jpeg?resize=1024%2C924&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan standing in a astreet with murals behind him\" class=\"wp-image-12529\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C924&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C271&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C693&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1386&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1847&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Born in a mid-sized city in Argentina, Juan was raised in a family in which music, arts and sports were always an essential part of everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“These activities encourage human beings to be creative and participative, and at the same time they are highly formative when it comes to mould people in order to become part of a group, a team, a community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The youngest of five siblings, Juan became highly motivated, trying to follow the steps of his siblings. Having a computer at home, he started to make connections that laid the foundation for his career as a developer. His interest in computers grew through that access to a machine running MS-DOS &#8211; the one with the black screen command line! Mastering this became a challenge to him and something to share with others. Through doing this, he found a way to more social interaction and new friendships.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Without being conscious of it, my friends and I were sharing pieces of code.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “I started learning some super easy stuff that made me feel like Houdini at that time. I could save a game play, something intangible, on a floppy disk and carry that piece of plastic and magnetic material back home. I was saving the play or game in a square object and then loading that back at home. I now realize, those were my first interactions with computer commands. Without being conscious of it, my friends and I were sharing pieces of code in a unique way.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This interest grew further through computer magazines and experimenting as &#8220;there was always something new to learn.” Although sport became a big part of Juan’s life in his teens, he kept up his computer learning. Taking a new direction, he found online tutorials enabling him to learn how to play the guitar. This led to setting up a punk rock band with his friends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Education has always been important in my family, and thanks to my parent’s efforts, I attended a school where I learned to express myself in another language.” The school had hired a satellite internet connection in the mid-nineties and had HTML on the computer studies program. These facilities were not that common in Argentina or many other countries either at that time. Also, his parents had the foresight to secure a rare internet connection at the house in 1997. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan recalled: “Browsing around the Internet opened a new universe in my mind. This new universe was extremely fantastic but also extremely expensive. I needed to make the most of every second online.”<br><br>“It was a whole new world and one thing led to the other. I started learning a bit of everything, editing graphics, scripting and so on. I still remember my first website in the fantastic sunset strip, Geocities.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Trying to go pro</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After high school, Juan moved to the city along with his brother and began to study IT at University. When he was asked by a friend to work at a software company, he decided to try that whilst continuing his studies. Through his job he had the chance to explore web-related opportunities, and with a friend from university, they started managing teams and projects across Latin America and Spain.<br><br>Juan describes this experience as one of the most fulfilling in his life. He was able to travel abroad for work, experience remote working, manage teams, present projects and speak formally in front of senior people. As the company grew at a fast pace, they learned how to set up and run a large organization. Eventually, he decided to drop out of his university program and focus on the opportunity of learning first hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan riding a bicycle in a historical city during his travels\" class=\"wp-image-12509\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key early learning from working internationally was that business and web development could be just as fast-moving and successful in Argentina as in other places. “I realized there’s no such thing as a secret sauce for success. Projects are backed by people’s talent and time, and you can find that in any latitude.”<br><br>By his mid-20s, Juan decided he wanted to try building something from scratch. He created a social network for photo sharing in Latin America, which was used by more than 30,000 people across Latin America and Spain in its time. Through this, he discovered that other people had a blog and he did not want to be left behind. The discovery of WordPress was to change the focus of his life.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hello to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Spending some time traveling around Europe, Juan found himself ‘surrounded by uncertainty’ and worried about what the future could bring. “I had some clues, but under uncertainty, the more you ask the less you answer. I started thinking about embracing the following philosophy: I didn’t want to be part of a large company, I didn’t want to continue studying and I wanted to travel as much as I could.” He did not realize at that time how this vision for his life was to mirror what he would find in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He started using WordPress for a few sites in 2005. By 2007 he was using it for almost everything. He was struck by the magnitude and range of what the software could do, from a simple tool used to create a blog in the blink of an eye through to complex projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His first problem-solving project was simple and saved data received through a contact form plugin. “To complete this project I discovered the Codex and I learned how easy and intuitive it is to create a plugin. I had fallen in love with WordPress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I was truly amazed by how I could learn from others.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As he explored the options with the software, Juan was unsure of how intellectual property worked and wanted to be respectful of other people’s work. “I didn’t understand open source yet, and I wasn’t sure if I was stealing from others. That was my first interaction with GPL and open source. I was truly amazed by how I could learn from others and improve things created by others or by myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He realized: “WordPress was the way to go if I wanted to pursue a dream of traveling, skipping winter, and working at the same time; what we now call a digital nomad. I already knew how to work remotely, I could work for companies located anywhere, as long as they could communicate in English or Spanish.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan started his own web agency, where he provided services to small and medium-sized companies abroad in the USA, UK, and Australia. He built his reputation and developed strong relationships in WordPress. “The experience couldn’t be better. I was learning, having fun, making a living out of it, and at the same time exploring the world.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In mid-2012, he discovered the full power of the WordPress community firsthand. In his spare time he started developing themes and from all he heard, wanted to attend a major event with lots of others in WordPress, a WordCamp. He took the plunge and booked for WordCamp in Edinburgh, in the UK. He said: “I got to meet many super talented people, and the atmosphere of the event was awesome. A place where competitors were also colleagues. Seeing the humility of somebody like Mike Little, the co-founder of WordPress, was amazing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “While there, unconsciously, I started dreaming of holding something like that in Argentina &#8211; the joy of hosting the WordPress community in my home country.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back home, while browsing the Codex, he happened to see that WordPress was turning 10. A lot of meetups were going to be organized worldwide to celebrate the birthday. But there was nothing organized in Argentina. This was a catalyst for starting a local meetup. Together with a colleague, he&nbsp; organized an Argentinian 10th birthday meetup. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 20 people showed up. “There was a common denominator. We all loved WordPress, it was part of our day-to-day life. We wanted to share experiences, make new friends and continue growing from what we could learn from others. That day we were a group of people with shared interests. That’s the simplest way to define a community, isn’t it?” This early meetup led to the formation of what is now called <a href=\"http://wpargentina.org/\">WordPress Argentina</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his desire to skip winters and do more traveling, his next adventure was to take him to visit family working in the US and attend one of the biggest WordCamps in the world in San Francisco. His interest kept growing and he traveled across Europe to be part of the first edition of WordCamp Europe in the Netherlands in 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “There’s almost nothing I could write to fully express what you experience in such events. They are the main WordPress events worldwide. The best part: I made a lot of good friends from many different places. I’m glad I have more excuses to continue traveling.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again in Argentina, our organization started growing thanks to the energy of the whole group, we started hosting formal meetups. In May 2015, we crowned all these efforts with a new <a href=\"https://buenosaires.wordcamp.org/2015/\">WordCamp in Buenos Aires</a>, Argentina.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan speaking at WordCamp Buenos Aires\" class=\"wp-image-12528\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Organizing such an event in my home country with many of the contributors I had met from the very first meetup was an experience I will always keep with me.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan believes one of his biggest contributions to open source was as part of being able to expand the community in Argentina and to share this with other Latin American and Spanish speaking countries. He also contributes as a volunteer translator in the Polyglots Team, to the Make WordPress Support team, and contributes to code blocks and Gutenberg. “I am really excited about seeing the future of Gutenberg as it is the future of WordPress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout his time contributing, Juan believes in helping to set the foundations and encouraging others to give their time and talents. He is keen to share that contributing does not have to be the same all the time and that you can have breaks and focus on one area in a particular period too. He gives the example of how in his spare time he watches Trac, where tickets about the software are logged, and looks where he might be able to help or think of solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “Anytime I find I can contribute to or make improvements in code-related areas, I will do as it is important to keep giving to the community. I enjoy crawling over meta, trac, GitHub and the different places that are requesting help. There is always somewhere you can help. At the moment, my focus is code and translations. I always try to save time to help these two areas. It is like you give and you get, you learn things. You meet amazing people and opportunities arrive.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding your path in WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505.jpeg?resize=768%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan sat in a street cafe surrounded by parked motorcycles\" class=\"wp-image-12527\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=1152%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1152w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Life is about experiences, it is about the people you surround yourself with and trying to do what you love.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we&#8217;re talking about who WordPress is built for. I was talking to a group of contributors last week and we encountered some questions around just who WordPress is built for. And it&#8217;s a question that you&#8217;ll find any time that you&#8217;re working on user testing or on triaging tickets, and especially when that comes up when you look at the big picture, roadmap sorts of things. The easiest answer for this question is, of course, everyone because WordPress&#8217; mission is to democratize publishing and that should be available to everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>[00:01:11]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, everyone is a really big target and certainly doesn&#8217;t help get your mind around the people that you&#8217;re wanting to actually build it for, the people that you actually want to be able to use your product, your software on a day-to-day basis. So let&#8217;s take a look at the one question that can help us figure out who it&#8217;s built for today and how we get it to being something that&#8217;s built forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, there&#8217;s a basic premise of open source that informs this thought. And that premise is that we are citizens of a community of contributors therefore the decisions are made by the people who show up. In general, I believe that to be true, though, I also believe that some basic qualifications are needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:50]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with that in mind, the one question that can help us figure out who a software is built for is this: how do your active contributors see themselves? I would bet that most contributors to open source software projects, like WordPress, are developers of some sort, it is sort of written right into the definition of the project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you work on software, then you need developers. And what I love about WordPress, in particular, is that we do work to include contributors who are not developers. Yet it still remains true that there is a fairly high level of technical knowledge required to actively contribute.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:2:25]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which kind of brings us to the second half of the original question of how can we make sure that WordPress can be something that&#8217;s built for everyone? The answer to this one is easy to say, hard to do, and that is to make sure to include them as co-creators in the development process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve talked about co-creators in open source before. It&#8217;s this idea that people who use the software every day are likely to know the biggest pain points. So if you want your software to be used by people who don&#8217;t know HTML, talk to a bunch of people who don&#8217;t know HTML about how it is to use your software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want your software to be mostly used by enterprise agencies, talk to enterprise agencies, but also ask them what their clients hate, because everyone has more than one stakeholder. And I know that I said this already, but it bears repeating that, obviously, this is all very easy to say and hard to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:3:20]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what is my best guess for the how-to-do part for WordPress? There are three things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is testing. This not only helps bring in new contributors and helps train future contributors, which I&#8217;ve talked about on the podcast before. But testing also gives us a higher chance of actionable feedback from folks who don&#8217;t necessarily spend time directly in the WordPress project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frequently the feedback that we do get that is just kind of undirected and ad hoc is exactly that– it is undirected and ad hoc and is then hard to follow up on and make sure that we understand what was wrong and how we can help fix it. And so testing is important for that. And testing it turns out is important for a bunch of things. When you&#8217;re working in open source.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing is support. So checking in with support teams at hosts, as well as the hardworking support teams in the project. And that can really help us to get early indications of what difficulties exist now. They have routinely seen problems and issues that are raised in support forums, and from their everyday users that they are providing support to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That probably could be fixed in WordPress if we had a good understanding of just what was not going right, how many people really needed it to go better, and what our targets were to fix that particular problem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:4:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing is communication. I know that I&#8217;ve gone on record in many places as saying that most of our problems at the end of the day are communication problems. And I&#8217;m going on record about it again here in this podcast, establishing better communication patterns with users is key.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That can be a multi-year project in itself. And even after that, it&#8217;s going to be an ongoing journey. But it is one of the many things that WordCamps and other WordPress events have given to us over the years, an opportunity to really hear from and see the struggles that people who are not building with WordPress every day, or literally building WordPress every day are actually having.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:5:34]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now that you&#8217;ve heard my small list of way too big things, that brings us to our regular small list of big things. The first thing is that WordCamp Europe is still looking for volunteers. If you&#8217;ve never done that before, I think it&#8217;s quite fun. You get to meet a lot of people and the team of organizers is super fun, but I&#8217;ll leave a link for you in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a new code-free way to contribute through the photo directory. That team is just getting started and still is working toward building out its programs. So now&#8217;s a good time to drop in and just kind of see what they are up to. And finally, a reminder that we do have contributors who are affected by the war in Ukraine right now. I will reshare the list of humanitarian organizations in case you missed them a couple of weeks ago as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:6:21]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for this WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12451\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"WordPress 5.9.2 Security and Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/03/wordpress-5-9-2-security-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 02:24:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"5.9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12421\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:367:\"WordPress 5.9.2&#160;is now available!

I have Matt here with me today because we want to acknowledge that we are once again at the start of a very difficult time. Neither of us would presume to know what it&#8217;s like to be at the heart of such massive disruption in our lives. But who would we be if we didn&#8217;t stop and check in with you all, the project that we hold so dear? And with that, I&#8217;ll hand it right over to you, Matt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello everyone. First, I want to thank Josepha for inviting me to join the WordPress Briefing to share what’s been on my mind in light of recent global events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been listening and watching events escalate in Ukraine, often in a state of shock. The scale alone is hard to take in. I mean, in the last 7 days, more than 500,000 people have fled their homes, more refugees are expected every day. The downstream humanitarian crises of the invasion are unimaginable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And seeing destruction in the world we live in is confusing, disconcerting, and difficult. In my experience, open source and WordPress bring people together; people from other countries and cultures, people that we know as friends and colleagues. Technology connects us, regardless of where we are. Nothing can negate the bad things happening in the world, but when I see how this community of contributors collaborates, regardless of borders, you all remind me of the good in the world every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>01:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I firmly believe that the web can be an equalizer and a force for good in the world. To me, the WordPress project is the epitome of goodness—everyone has a voice, a platform, and a community. You have the power to make your corner of the world, and the web, a sanctuary for those who need it—especially now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>01:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you or someone you know is affected by this war, I encourage you to be present as the ramifications unfold. While we may all feel fatigued and have a sense of languishing from the past two years of the Covid pandemic, the gift of time and support for one another cannot be overstated. I&#8217;m confident that every single person in the WordPress community will approach the situation in Ukraine with sensitivity and understanding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>02:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I invite you to join me in standing with those in the world working to end conflict and working toward a world of peace, promise, and opportunity. If you&#8217;re looking for a way to help support the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, I will offer some suggested NGOs, or Non-Governmental Organizations, that provide assistance to local peacebuilders in the region.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>02:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In closing, please know that my thoughts are with everyone in our community. I know that my words here can’t change anything there, but I hope that we all remember that words of support are never unwelcome. And we can never know when a little human kindness can help someone share the invisible heaviness in their heart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for that, Matt.

In 2007, Tonya started to face health challenges that had an impact on all that she had known.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>“My career defined me. It was my canvas and my art. When it was gone, I did not recognize myself.</strong></p><cite>Tonya Mork</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>One day, she woke up at home ready to visit a client’s facility where her firm was building a robotic system. She said: “As I headed for the door, I fell to my knees, as this wave of pain crushed down on my chest.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doctors diagnosed her with a very rare heart disease that caused her blood vessels to spasm, cutting off blood to whatever was downstream of the blockage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months later, she was diagnosed with a second rare and more serious condition, related to the migraines from which she had been suffering. Combined with her heart condition, this made every migraine attack life-threatening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For nearly seven years, the unexpected changes to her health left her mostly homebound and constantly monitored. This meant she had to close her engineering firm and say goodbye to staff and clients. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“My career defined me. It was my canvas and my art. When it was gone, I was lost. I didn’t recognize myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in her darkest hour, she found her strength. Tonya made a choice to move forward, and make the most of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When you are at rock bottom, you have to make a decision or else it will consume you. My decision was that I chose to be happy,” said Tonya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Tonya’s first steps was to start writing a blog using WordPress. In this she shared insights on how to find peace and joy in any situation. She wrote about kindness and helping one another.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The joy of making solutions through WordPress became a way for Tonya to accept her new life and not feel as limited by her health. She wanted purpose, and in WordPress, she found just that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya felt she could do something worthwhile in the virtual world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"a-ray-of-hope-for-tonya\">A ray of hope for Tonya</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?resize=1000%2C750&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12327\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2013, Tonya’s health deteriorated further. She was admitted into intensive care and was diagnosed with a third rare disease, this time related to her autoimmunity. She was not expected to survive this time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following what she describes as a ‘miraculous recovery,’ she became stronger and was able to stop relying on a wheelchair. She used the energy from working on websites to keep going. “WordPress kept my mind alive,” said Tonya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She had first used WordPress for her engineering firm’s intranet. But when she discovered the software’s full potential and the collaborative opportunities of open source, it opened a new world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>&#8220;Finding WordPress helped me to find myself again&#8221;</p><cite>Tonya Mork</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>During the years which followed, she donated her time to build some WordPress websites and plugins. She said: “Through giving my time, I was able to do something other than sit in isolation.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya was amazed by the sharing in open source in general and in WordPress in particular. She said: “I was amazed to see people sharing so much information freely with one another. In my former engineering world, information was proprietary. Throughout my career, I had worked to break down those silos and help anyone to understand complex systems. I was drawn to this open community.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also became aware that WordPress developers were hungry to learn more about development. She wanted to be part of the solution with her passion for teaching and the knowledge she had gained in industry.<br><br>She said: “Finding WordPress helped me to find myself again. Here in this community, I was able to feel like a person again, not a sick one, but a professional with something to give.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As her interest in the software grew, Tonya decided to start a non-profit where she turned to WordPress to build the websites. This re-sparked her interest in programming. She said: “I wanted to really know the code and understand what made it tick.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The realization led Tonya to start the WP Developers’ Club, which in turn spawned <a href=\"https://knowthecode.io/\">Know the Code</a>, to help educate individual developers, and is still used today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"from-helping-wordpress-companies-to-working-on-wordpress-core\">From helping WordPress companies to working on WordPress Core</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya-with-dog.jpg?resize=300%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Tonya pictured with her dog\" class=\"wp-image-12328\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya-with-dog.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya-with-dog.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya went on to work with big and medium size WordPress companies helping their developers and supporting them in raising their firms’ leverage with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By late 2020, she knew she wanted to do even more with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In February 2021, Tonya joined an international firm in the ecosystem and began working closely on WordPress Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time, WordPress Core was pulling together a new Triage team. Tonya started volunteering on that team to find collaborative solutions, and help others do so. In 2020 for <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/12/simone/\">WordPress 5.6 Simone</a>, she became the release’s Triage lead, and again for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-7/\">WordPress 5.7 Esperanza</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, she became a Test Team Rep and helped to expand the team and is an advocate for the value of testing and feedback in the release development process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"a-new-successful-chapter-with-wordpress-5-9\">A new, successful chapter with WordPress 5.9</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=1024%2C480&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Tonya was one of the notable contributors to the WordPress 5.9 release featured in this picture.\" class=\"wp-image-12329\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=1024%2C480&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=300%2C141&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=768%2C360&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=1536%2C719&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=2048%2C959&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya’s passion for the software and getting people involved in its growth continued. For the WordPress 5.9 release in 2021, she took on the role of both the Core Tech Lead and the Release Coordinator. As this was a big release and included the first major implementation of Full Site Editing, it had many moving parts and hundreds of contributors. She was able to share the skills she had learned in communication and project management from her days streamlining and documenting engineering software and processes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first 24 hours of WordPress 5.9 landing, it had more than 10 million downloads—and 17 formally reported bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"giving-back-to-open-source\">Giving back to open source</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now in what Tonya describes as her third chapter. She said: “I’m a very different person from the engineer I used to know. What really matters in this world is when you reach out and make a difference in someone’s life.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She feels she has found her purpose in this life. “I’m on a mission to give back and make a difference. Teaching is how I will do it. And in WordPress I have found my professional home, and I have all this software knowledge that I just want to share.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"share-the-stories\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"contributors-to-this-feature\">Contributors to this feature</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Tonya Mork (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/hellofromtonya/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>hellofromtonya</a>) for sharing her story. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interviews and feature by Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>) and Mary Baum (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a>).

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project. Some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy &#8211; here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:00:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a non-mailbag mailbag question that I would like to answer for y&#8217;all today. Non-mailbag because no one actually emailed me about it and mailbag because Twitter is basically like a giant mailbag. And I do get a lot of DMS about this particular topic. If you want to send something to my actual WP Briefing mailbag, you can send it to <a href=\"mailto:wpbriefing@worpress.org\">wpbriefing@worpress.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:06]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the question that I frequently get asked in my DMS on Twitter is: what is Five for the Future? It&#8217;s not always that tidy the question, but that still is the question we&#8217;re answering today. So if you take a casual survey of active contributors to the WordPress project, the high-level answer that you&#8217;re likely to get to that question is “a way to remind people to give back to the project.” Or, if you run in more business-y circles, you might hear that it is an initiative that encourages companies to give back 5% of their resources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And both of those answers are true. So a quick mini-history lesson; the original concept of Five for the Future came from Matt Mullenweg in 2014. There&#8217;s a lovely blog post on it that I will link in the notes below, but it was essentially a call to any companies experiencing success with WordPress to contribute back to the project and make sure that the project was a success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:02:07]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial program then included outreach recognition, et cetera, proposed in 2017 by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/liljimmi/\">Tracy Levesque</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/iandunn/\">Ian Dunn</a>. Then that was defined and formalized with the help of the WordPress community in 2018. And then, in 2019, we had our first trial run with entire dedicated teams sponsored by companies inside the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:02:36]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the mini-history lesson chronology of this program. The intentions that informed the work of building the program in 2017 have become a bit lost to the ages. So I&#8217;m here to share it with you. The basic heart and soul of the Five for the Future program is to make sure that there is a way to refresh the commons of the WordPress community and ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a result, ensure that the common resources of WordPress are available long after we have stopped being available to care for them. If you are familiar with the concept of the tragedy of the commons, Five for the Future was created to help avoid that tragedy. There were two original goals for formalizing the program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:22]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one was to acknowledge companies that participated in Five for the Future by sponsoring contributors to work on the WordPress project. And the second was to motivate more companies to sponsor more volunteers. Either by hiring them and paying them to contribute or by assigning their existing employees to contribute to the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, it&#8217;s hard to quantify participation and hard to qualify what should be seen as an impactful contribution, which is why when the program was originally created, it was in partnership with team reps and community members who were active at the time. There are many posts around that discuss the next steps for this program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:07]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I&#8217;m looking through them, the next steps revolve around some of the hardest and most important questions that we have to answer as a project and as stewards of open source. Those questions are things like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li> How do we remain true to these gloriously subversive values of WordPress and open source while also finding a way to thoughtfully secure our organization&#8217;s future?</li><li>Does contributing without the expectation of reciprocity hold up when we are looking at how to acknowledge contributors who sustain us?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re familiar with Elinor Ostrom&#8217;s award-winning work, Governing the Commons, you may also be wondering how this particular program aligns with her eight principles designed to sustain organizations like ours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:57]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an aside to that last question, this particular program does not have all eight principles accounted for, but among WordPress&#8217;s many programs, we do account for most of them. Although imperfectly, as is the way with human beings, that&#8217;s probably a whole episode unto itself, I did want to quickly answer that particular question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:16]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to get back to my non-mailbag, mailbag question, if I had to tell you in the span of an elevator ride what Five for the Future was, this would be my answer. <strong>It is a v1 program with a dual goal of boldly declaring the need to refresh the shared resources of WordPress and offering the ways and means for communities and individuals alike to participate in refreshing those resources</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to learn more about the Five for the Future initiative, you can check out wordpress.org/5. Like literally just the number five. Or, if you want to learn more about the program that has grown from the Five for the Future initiative, you can check out the white paper that&#8217;s linked in the notes below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:11]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. Number one on my small list, the planning post for WordPress 6.0 is out. I&#8217;ve included a link in my massive list of links below. But it includes our best guess at timing, features that we intend to include, and a call for volunteers as well. So if you are looking for ways to give back, that is a clear and immediate option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:38]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on the list is if you are a team rep, don&#8217;t forget that we have daylight saving time ending and starting depending on your hemisphere within the month. If you move meetings, if you&#8217;re in a team that moves your meetings, discuss it now so that folks have time to adjust their calendars.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:55]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing on my small list of big things is that there&#8217;s a suite of Full Site Editing courses that are now available on learn.wordpress.org. I will add that to my giant list of links below, but I encourage you to wander on over and see what all the fuss is about. I think the courses are excellent.

Some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of weeks ago, I published a post about the big picture goals for the WordPress project in 2022. As I was thinking through our planned releases for the year and looking out toward what would spell success for WordPress over the next three years, three things really lined up in both sets of answers for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I provided some detail on how we can work toward these goals in the post, which I will link for you in the show notes, but I also wanted to take some time to explain why I feel we have to work toward these goals this year. So these all build on one another. To refresh your memory of the three big focuses, they are one to drive adoption of the new editor in WordPress, support open source alternatives for site building necessities, and three, open source stewardship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first one; is driving the adoption of the new WordPress editor. Early on in the start of the Gutenberg Project, folks could not go two days without hearing me talk about the phases of adoption and how those line up with the phases of Gutenberg, and who would need our support the most in each of those phases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have always believed that what we would be shipping at this point in our project would prove the plausible promise of what we were doing in phase one. That&#8217;s definitely what I&#8217;m seeing from what was shipped in 5.9, as well as what we plan to ship in May with 6.0. And the people who need the most support right now are absolutely our users, your clients, no matter whether they were not keeping up with WordPress developments or simply were waiting to see what all the fuss was about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be people who look to you as someone who has been here a while to help them make sense of what they&#8217;re seeing. And what I find so exciting about this adoption, sort of, work in the WordPress project is that this is the time when we as practitioners of WordPress, no matter whether you are a designer or a developer or builder, business coach. This is the time when we get to guide others through the hardest parts of our learning processes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process of helping people to learn new technologies relies not only on your hard-won expertise but also on the belief that the future is worth fighting for. Enabling someone’s success is an investment in the future and investment for that person or for WordPress or your community. All investments are welcome here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:28</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, table stakes are just that you care. And speaking of future investments, the second focus is open source alternatives for site building necessities. So things like images, forms, stores, themes, etc. It literally just things you need to build a site. I would like to start by saying that I am completely aware of the fact that 99% of WordPress users will never care about open source freedoms and philosophies in the same way that WordPress maintainers and contributors care about open source freedoms and philosophies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could substitute the name of any other open source project right there, and the statement would still be true. And yet, I will always believe that people should have the rights and freedoms that open source brings to them even if they do not know they are there. And so it makes all the sense in the world to me that as a project and open source community, we should strive to make choosing Open Source as easy as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, open source stewardship is one of the focuses for this year. This one is obviously about supporting open source as a concept and maintaining WordPress as a project. But I also think that it is relevant to our current global circumstances. Open Source suddenly became very visible to the public eye last year following the Log4J vulnerability, and ever since then, I&#8217;ve been hearing consistent concern over how We make sure that WordPress is sustainable moving into the future. Fortunately, this is a topic that&#8217;s near and dear to my heart. And I have been delighted to see so many community members bringing that conversation to the forefront.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:14</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a lot that is done in the WordPress project to keep us from the tragedy of the commons. But that work honestly never ends. Not only does it not end, but as we get bigger, there is more and more that we can and should be doing to keep us around for the long term. And, of course, for the keen readers of my posts, there&#8217;s a bonus focus.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bonus focus is, of course, that WordPress turns 20 years old next year. This year, we will also be seeing some preparatory work for that major milestone as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that brings us today to our small list of big things. There is a redesign of the News Page coming. We&#8217;ve been talking about this over on make.wordpress.org/design for a bit since like June of last year or something. But it&#8217;s coming in the next few weeks. I&#8217;ll share a link to the GitHub repo in case anyone has any specific things that they see as they are reading through all of our many news stories that come out on that particular page.

This is more than just a new default theme. It’s a brand-new way to work with WordPress themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/block-themes/\">Block themes</a> put a wide array of visual choices directly in your hands, from color schemes and font combinations to page templates and image filters, all from the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/site-editor/\">Site Editor</a>. So in one place, you can give Twenty Twenty-Two the same look and feel as your organization’s other materials—or take your site’s look in another direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You already have the Twenty Twenty-Two theme—it came installed with WordPress 5.9. You will find it with your other installed themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"903\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?resize=1204%2C903&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12102\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"your-personal-paintbox-awaits\">Your personal paintbox awaits</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty Twenty-Two is not the only theme built for full site editing. More block themes are in the Themes directory, and the number will grow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you use any of those new themes, you no longer need the Customizer. Instead, you have all the power of the Styles interface inside the Site Editor. Just as in Twenty Twenty-Two, you build your site’s look and feel there, with the tools you need for the job in a fluid interface that practically comes alive in your hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"903\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?resize=1204%2C903&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12103\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"the-navigation-block\">The Navigation block</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Blocks come to site navigation, the heart of user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Navigation block gives you the power to choose: an always-on responsive menu or one that adapts to your user’s screen size.

And you can edit them as you see fit. Need something different in the header or footer for your theme? Swap it out with a new one in a few clicks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a nearly full-screen view that draws you in to see fine details, the Pattern Explorer makes it easy to compare patterns and choose the one your users need.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"903\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-6.png?resize=1204%2C903&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12106\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-6.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-6.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-6.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-6.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"a-revamped-list-view\">A revamped List View</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 5.9, the List View lets you drag and drop your content exactly where you want it.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday marked three years since the WordPress project welcomed me as their executive director. As I start my fourth year, I&#8217;ve spent a bit of time considering what the next five years will bring us. WordPress will turn 19 this year, which means that we will soon be a whopping 20 years old; for some of the people who have been with the project since the beginning, that can represent two-thirds of their whole life. And even if you were not that young when you got here, two decades as an open source project is really a cause for celebration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not in that group that has been here forever. I showed up for the first time in 2009, as a community organizer, self-sponsored, and I learned so much about myself as a person and as a leader while I was doing that. So when I arrived as a sponsored contributor in 2015, I already knew exactly what made this work so fulfilling for me was these three things:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, the ability to lend a hand in those moments where I wish someone had lent a hand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second is the delight of seeing people&#8217;s first successes and the joy of watching them grow over time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:48</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third was a chance to be part of something great, which turned out to be something greater; greater than me or you or a CMS.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:58</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This list is still at the heart of what I feel I get out of the WordPress project. But it has also grown substantially in my seven years as a sponsored contributor. I now also love how we as a community of contributors get to foster a better way to lead and a better way to collaborate. And through those things help people find a way to have a better life. Not just through WordPress, the CMS, but through WordPress, the people, and WordPress, the project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so when I think of what I want for WordPress in its 19th year, so that we can head with confidence and dignity into our 20th year, it is this:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want you to remember that you are not alone here. People come together in the world often because of a shared location. But WordPress fosters this beautiful experience of bringing us together because of what we care about. Whether you care about PHP standards, diversity in technology, helping people with their first big wins, making WordPress more secure. I mean, if what you care about is being able to write the most arcane and complex apps on top of WordPress that the world has ever seen. Then there are others out there who want to do that with you, too. We have so many things to connect about. And fortunately, we support a great piece of software for getting our thoughts out in the world. Take some time to see who else shares your thoughts and potentially learn a bit about the view from the other side.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of the other side, I also want us to approach our discussions as the US versus the Problem TM. WordPress may be 20 years old, and we may stand on the shoulders of giants, but right now, the people who are here you, you are explorers and creators and guides toward the best possible future for WordPress. The tension that we witness between teams is always about the best possible answers for the people who use our software. It is about securing the freedoms of the open web for everyone who comes after us whether they know they need those freedoms or not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, I want us to expand our reasons for doing this at all. If you are a member of the community of contributors, We frequently talk about how we give back because WordPress gave to us. Or if you are part of a Five for the Future group. You have heard that companies who have experienced success because of WordPress should commit 5% of their resources back to the project to ensure WordPress&#8217; long-term success. But the reason that I keep doing this, and hopefully a new reason for you to keep doing this is that we can take part in securing opportunities for future users of WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I want WordPress to be the best CMS. Yes, I want this community to be vibrant and engaged. Yes, I want WordPress to be a shining beacon of how to work remotely. And I want all of that because I know it is our careful and tireless stewardship of this project that lets us continue to lend a hand in those moments where people wish for someone to lend a hand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are my hopes for WordPress in 2022 to move us forward into WordPress of the future. I hope you all will come with me and we can continue our journey together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks again for listening. I&#8217;m Josepha Haden and this is the WP Briefing. See you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12043\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"WordPress 5.9 RC 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/01/wordpress-5-9-rc-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 20:43:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"5.9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"RC2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12014\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:117:\"The second Release Candidate (RC2) for WordPress 5.9 is available!

Testing for bugs is not just a critical part of polishing every release, it is also a great way to contribute to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-help\"><strong>How to Help</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2021/11/30/help-test-wordpress-5-9-features/\">Help test WordPress 5.9 features</a> – a guide to how you can take part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you write in another language other than English?

His fascination with development and learning continued to grow, and he now makes a living using WordPress and the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on to discover his story, which shows with creativity and determination you can create products and make a living using WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"starting-web-building-on-a-phone\"><strong>Starting web building on a phone</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"350\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/12/collins-agbonghama1.jpg?resize=350%2C426&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Collins Agbonghama headshot photo\" class=\"wp-image-11920\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/12/collins-agbonghama1.jpg?w=350&amp;ssl=1 350w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/12/collins-agbonghama1.jpg?resize=246%2C300&amp;ssl=1 246w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Collins began his exploration of the internet while attending Secondary School in Nigeria, or High School as it is known in some other countries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A friend at the school had a simple mobile phone which could browse the internet. Collins had his first introduction to the World Wide Web through access to this device. He became hooked by reading headlines on a sports site about a famous English Premier League Football Club, Chelsea, a soccer team which he has long supported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Being a very inquisitive person, I wanted to learn how the web works as well as have my own website. I was able to buy a classic mobile phone through the menial jobs I did after school,” he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His first website was a wapsite or Wireless Application Protocol site optimized for mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He took to Google to learn how to actually build a site. He discovered he needed something called an ‘email address’ to sign-up for site builders. Google Search came to the rescue again, and he created the first email account for his first website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A desire for a website was the catalyst for further learning, starting with HTML and CSS from an online provider. His interest in building sites with more advanced tools grew, and then he came across WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using his savings, he bought the cheapest hosting plan from a local Nigerian web host. He installed WordPress and started writing tutorials for a mobile device platform. He built the site, created the lessons, and started his entry into WordPress all on a mobile phone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This led to him having the confidence to start building sites for others, and he was able to earn a small income from that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collins said: “I couldn’t go to the university because of my precarious financial situation. I continued to do menial jobs during the day and started learning PHP in the evenings and at night using my mobile phone via online learning platforms.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was later able to get an old laptop, which helped him access ebooks to learn more and practice his coding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keen to share this learning, he started blogging about what he was learning on his website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collins said: “I later took up a job teaching children at a school primarily because I got tired of the menial jobs and wanted to earn enough to take care of my internet data plan. After a while, I became fairly proficient in PHP and even took up a job to build a school management system.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"using-wordpress-to-make-a-living\"><strong>Using WordPress to make a living</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Collins’ blog wasn’t making money through advertisements, but he discovered opportunities to write tutorials for other platforms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I started writing PHP and WordPress development tutorials and got paid a few hundred dollars per article. In Nigeria, that’s quite a lot of money. I was able to improve the life and wellbeing of my family and myself,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After getting into a higher education program to study computer science, his life dramatically changed. He decided to stop writing and began to focus on building and selling WordPress plugins.&nbsp;His first one was a user and profile plugin for WordPress sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Thankfully, after a year, it started making enough revenue for me to live pretty comfortably here in Nigeria because the cost of living here is relatively low,” he said</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Collins has several plugins which have given him a sustainable source of income. He’s also a Core and Translation volunteer contributor to the WordPress.org Open Source project. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>I am thankful for WordPress because without it, I’m really not sure I would have been able to live a decent quality life. <br>Who knows what would have become of me?</p><cite>Collins Agbonghama</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“I am also thankful for the community. I have made lots of friends that have been very supportive and helpful in my journey.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “I tell people, life won’t give you what you want. You demand from life what you want. You make these demands by being determined and never giving up on your dreams and aspirations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If you are poor, perhaps because you came from a humble and poor background, it is not your fault.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:00:40]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomorrow&#8217;s a big day. It marks the beginning of what is called the RC period, or release candidate period, for the current major release of the WordPress CMS. If you&#8217;re not super familiar with the way release cycles work, this is the point in the process where the code should pretty much be done changing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That way you can call in your designers, developers, and anyone else who builds things for others using your software. And they can either start testing their products on it, or they can figure out what new things they need to be able to teach their clients, whichever is most relevant to them. That is generally true for WordPress as well, but in true open source fashion, there is a caveat built in that helps us to get in last-minute, vital changes from contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a two-person sign-off rule that&#8217;s been around for about as long as I can remember, but lets things be added late in the release cycle, as long as there are two sign-offs from qualified contributors. Most of the time, those qualified contributors are lead developers of the project, but not always. We have a good group of people who are around helping us make sure that this is doable and the best thing that we can offer to all of our users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:50]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, yeah, two-person sign-off, that is the little bit of release process trivia that you never knew you needed. And since we&#8217;re looking at a release trivia, kind of hidden bits of how software is made, I actually have a guest with me today, Channing Ritter. So Channing is a product and visual designer based in Brooklyn, New York.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She&#8217;s a design director at Automattic and has been working on the WordPress project as a full-time sponsored contributor since January, 2021. She is joining us to share some behind the scenes intel on what&#8217;s going into the 6.0 release, her role in that process, and then we&#8217;ll just kind of see how the conversation goes from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:40]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, and with that, I&#8217;d like to welcome Channing to the WordPress Briefing. Hi Channing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter </strong>00:02:45]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey Josepha. Thanks so much for having me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:02:48] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m excited to have you here. If I understand, you are working on the design side of things with the release. So why don&#8217;t you tell me a little bit about the role you&#8217;ve played?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:02:59] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am. I am the design release lead for the 6.0 release. And if I understand correctly, this is a position that has been unfulfilled for the past few release cycles. So I&#8217;m kind of the first person to step in over the past few releases. And I think that&#8217;s really exciting, especially because design has started to play such a more important role in the WordPress project over the past few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it makes sense that design would have a seat at the table, and I&#8217;m really excited to be helping advocate for the design team and learning from other folks on the release squad. Who&#8217;ve been doing this for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:03:33] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. First big question about 6.0, what is the feature that you are most excited about?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:03:39] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m most excited about the style switcher within the global styles panel. Um, so if folks still don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about there, it&#8217;s the ability to change between different variations of the theme.json without actually switching the theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is a way to get a drastically different look and feels across your site with just a single click. And I see it as a really fun place to experiment and kind of get inspired for the different ways your site could appear without ever having to change your theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in terms of the Twenty Twenty-Two variations, they&#8217;re just really gorgeous and all so diverse. Like you have the main default theme that has the deep green and kind of peachy colors and this really elegant type treatment with a really thin Serif typeface. But then the variations are so different from that. And I think my favorite one is the Swiss variation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:04:36]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Swiss variation?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:04:38]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, every graphic design nerd loves Swiss design.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:04:42] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, ok! Now I know!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:04:38] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Really awesome things found in there. It&#8217;s a really high contrast, bold variation. It&#8217;s kind of black and white with red accents. I just love how different it is from the default style and how easy it is to change up your site and just get a whole drastically different look and feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:05:00] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s excellent. So for folks who do not know what we&#8217;re referring to, when we talk about the Twenty Twenty-Two variation, that is the default theme, Twenty Twenty-Two. I&#8217;ll put a link to both the classic and block-based versions in our show notes, but you&#8217;ll want to use the block-based version to look at these style variations that Channing has mentioned here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:05:24] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we&#8217;re really excited that the first-ever default block theme was released with 5.9, which is when Twenty Twenty-Two first went out and was bundled with 5.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, with 6.0, I think even more so it&#8217;s starting to showcase the real power of block themes and what can actually be done there. And style variations is a huge kind of first step into this new world of block themes and starting to really open up the possibilities and all the flexibility that you have there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:05:55] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, absolutely. So when we&#8217;re talking about the Twenty Twenty-Two default theme, when we&#8217;re talking about switching these variations inside the theme itself, that seems to me to be a very user-focused kind of feature. And when we talk about users in WordPress, there&#8217;s a lot of room for interpretation. Like if we look at it kind of in a framework of three types of users of WordPress, you have, like end-users. So people who are site owners using it as a site to, like, enable their business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you also have mid-end users—people who use it to build sites for others. And what I like to call back-end users, people who are using WordPress as a framework. And of course at the start of the Gutenberg project, way back in forever, a million years ago, one of the big calls to action that we had around even, like, trying to do this, was that we wanted to make WordPress easier for users. Just plain users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and to me, that means making WordPress easier for those mid-end users, people who are creating WordPress sites for other people. But also should give some power and autonomy back to those end-users, the people who are using sites to enable their business or are site owners.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:07:14] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so in that context, between 5.9 and 6.0, do you feel like we have features that are really giving that kind of power and agency back to our end-users? Do you feel like we have some features that are really focused on those mid-end users, as opposed to our backend users? For a long time, we focused heavily on enabling our backend users, and now Gutenberg kind of moves us into those other two areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so do you think that things like being able to switch between your style of variations, other things like that are moving us closer to that particular goal of Gutenberg?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:07:51] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a great question. I think it&#8217;s both. I think some of the features being released in 6.0 are absolutely going to empower that end-user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Particularly in terms of improvements around design tools and some of the quality of life improvements. For example, partially selecting across multiple blocks and being able to partially select texts there. That&#8217;s the type of thing that really brings the writing experience in the editor to be on par with how you would expect a text editing experience to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there are tons of small quality of life improvements in this release that I think are really gonna help those end-users. But there are also improvements around what we might call the maintainers who are building sites for others. I think block locking in particular is something that is really going to start filling a gap between people who build the sites and then people who do the day-to-day maintenance within a site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in 6.0, we&#8217;re introducing some interface UI around block locking, but also there&#8217;ll be control around the ability to lock user roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:09:03]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which I think makes a lot of sense. I mean, we have all of these user roles in the CMS itself, and for a long time, we&#8217;ve just been like free for all on blocks, which was great and is great and should be available to people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also if we are saying, like, it makes sense to have this gradient of users and their abilities for the CMS itself, and we are saying that we want to move control of the website and the content to be at the base layer in these blocks, then it also makes sense that we should be able to provide that same sort of granular level of access in the blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think that&#8217;s a great thing. If you all, if dear listeners, you do not know what we mean by “block locking,” I&#8217;m sure that I can find a link for us in our show notes below as well. If for anyone who&#8217;s been talking through Gutenberg things with me for a while, you know that this is one of the primary use cases that I think has been a long time coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:10:05]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was one of the first examples that I offered to folks when we had that question of like, who is this being built for? In what way is this beneficial to that mid-end user, as opposed to just giving all of the power and autonomy to users in a way that maybe is not the best for their visitors?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of those use cases that made the most sense to me being able to say, okay, well, the opportunity to, as somebody who runs an agency and is building websites for people to be able to say, yeah, ‘You can do anything that is possible in this instance of WordPress and all the things that you are allowed to do will not break your instance. It won&#8217;t break your website’.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it gives a lot of time back to agencies to focus on their client&#8217;s most important problems, as opposed to not knowing how to update the hours in their footer or something like that. And so I&#8217;m very excited about that particular feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:11:01]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s such a long-requested feature. I mean, we&#8217;ve been hearing requests around this particular feature for years and, you know, often when something gets requested over a span of years like that, it&#8217;s because there are some complexities to figure out how it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s definitely been the case with moving forward with block locking. And there are a lot of nuances there. But I think what you were saying, I totally agree with. There’s always a push and pull. And as we enable more and more flexibility for end-users, there needs to be a little bit of push from the other side to kind of give more granular controls, more locking options, and make sure that everything can still be easily maintained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:11:43]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, we mentioned in that answer the concept of maintainers. If you are a contributor, it&#8217;s not <em>that</em> kind of ‘maintainer.’ So if you&#8217;re a WordPress contributor and we said maintainers there, um, just know that that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re referring to. If you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about when I say ‘contributor,’ there is a whole community of open source people and maintainers are people who specifically take care of a particular part of the WordPress software or the WordPress project, um, that makes all this possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s, ya know….&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:12:19] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So true! The maintainer has another meaning in this context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:12:20]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, we have a mix in our audience and I love it, but it also makes me frequently spend like 10% of my podcast being like, by the way, when I said this, I didn&#8217;t mean you, but I did mean <em>you</em>, which makes it harder. I know.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. You’ve been with the project for a little bit, but if I recall correctly, this is the first time that you were, like, leading part of a release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what would you say was the most challenging part of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong>  00:12:52] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great question. This is my first time being this closely involved with the release. Although I was involved with the 5.9 release, but mostly in a release assets capacity. So I helped with the <em>About Page</em> and the welcome banner that goes on the dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I did get some insight in the last release cycle. Which was great preparation for being more involved as a release lead on this cycle. From the design perspective, one of the hardest things is always going to be figuring out what exactly goes into the release and what needs more time. In the sense, you know, that there might be some features that need to stay in the Gutenberg plugin for a while and get more testing before they get released to a much wider audience in a major WordPress release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think on the design side, we definitely have some goals that are big, long-term projects that are likely going to span across, you know, many releases, maybe even over many years. And I think the full site editor is a great example of that in a sense that it&#8217;s not something that you just were gone in one release and then it all gets released and then it&#8217;s all good to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong>  00:14:06] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s something that has to be staggered across many releases, and there&#8217;s a lot of thought that goes into it; does this make sense in this more limited capacity, and what else needs to go in in order for this feature to go in? And the most complex things about the WordPress project is how interconnected things are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you start making those decisions about what should go in, what should get pulled out, often there&#8217;s sort of a domino effect of like, well, that would affect this feature and then, well, maybe they shouldn&#8217;t go in, or maybe this does need to go in. And that is really one of the most challenging, but also one of the most fascinating aspects of the release process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:14:46] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. It is very, very true that there are kind of no small problems left in WordPress. *laughs* Yeah, when we, when we first started with this like bigger release squad, cause that has not been routine for the history of the project. When we first started with that, I know that expanding out the exposure to like how much one change affects 25 different things was really, it was really good for all of us to be reminded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I mentioned at the top of our episode today, tomorrow begins the RC period. It begins the release candidate period, which is when it&#8217;s supposed to be, as locked down as possible. But if you all have been following along with our release process in general, which if you&#8217;re listening to this, you probably have, you know that last week or a couple of weeks ago, we had this whole question about the Webfonts API, and we had that conversation in a public space as best we could,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, there are always things that you can&#8217;t, like, fully disclose in public spaces, but we had a very open and transparent conversation about, like, who is most affected by putting it in, in the state that the API was in. And, who&#8217;s most affected if we take it out. And where can we make compromises on either side so that both sides are a little happy and a little unhappy?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:16:09] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, like, that is all so hard to do. Not only in general. We have a 20-year-old code base and a five-year-old code base. And it&#8217;s all a big, big undertaking to understand what is happening and where it happens. And so there&#8217;s this moment always when we are trying to decide, like, is this baked enough? Did we put it in too early? Should we pull it out? How, if we pull it out, did we ask people to do too much work before we decided to pull it out anyway?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, you always have those kinds of questions about it. And honestly, I think that most of us weren&#8217;t around the last time, that WordPress was, was this experimental in public, like it&#8217;s always been open source. It&#8217;s always been experimental and iterating publicly, which is just the hardest way to work on anything. We like, we shipped our best guesses. Don&#8217;t be mad. It&#8217;ll be… we&#8217;re coming for it. We&#8217;re going to fix it. Like, that&#8217;s always hard, but the last time around, when it was this substantial a change was, like, 2008 or something, like, it was ages and ages ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong>  00:17:14] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we were smaller than, we had a smaller number of contributors. We had a smaller group of people actually using the CMS. And so over time it has gotten more and more complicated. And, and I don&#8217;t think that we can ever understate the complexities of that. And so for you, you had a little bit of exposure to it in 5.9 and then showed up for like really doing it in 6.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Has it been a surprising change? Like, were you surprised much more by how complicated it was when you were closer to it?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:17:47] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, definitely. It’s been a real learning process, especially coming to understand how much there really are no easy answers. I think a lot of us are in the release squad are real problem solver types of people and, and want it to, you know, be a really neat, tidy answer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s not always the case. You know, sometimes parts of the feature might go in, or some contingency plan might get put into place and things didn&#8217;t go exactly as planned. But what you said of being an experiment and being on kind of the cutting edge of trying out new things, I think there is a lot of passion around that in the WordPress project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, we&#8217;re in such a transitional period for the project, you know, moving from classic themes to block themes and really changing the ideas of how we approach designing sites. And because of that, I think there is a lot of momentum and energy around getting new features, as many new features as possible into each release. But there&#8217;s also, you know, a lot of testing and stuff that needs to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to make sure that, like you said, these things aren&#8217;t going out too early.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:19:01] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, and there&#8217;s always that difficulty, we&#8217;re going to just leap right into open source areas now. There&#8217;s always that difficulty around, like, there&#8217;s this concept that when, like, we always want to ship something that doesn&#8217;t break backward compatibility when possible, we don&#8217;t want to ship vulnerabilities. Like, that&#8217;s always true, but we are in an open source project, and open source projects are necessarily kind of tolerant of like, that&#8217;s not our best, but like it skates, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was, we aimed for Ferrari and got a skateboard because sometimes you got to start with a skateboard, right? *laughter* Like if it gets you from one place to another, that&#8217;s kind of where we&#8217;ve got to aim some days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:19:45] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Totally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong>  00:19:46] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s always so, so difficult, especially cause, like, for the big change that 5.0 represented, and that 5.9 represented– 6.0 is not as big a shock as 5.9 was.&nbsp; But, like, as big a change as those represented, it still skates. And that&#8217;s, I think what makes the work especially hard, especially nuanced. And like, we haven&#8217;t gotten together as human beings in two years. And so sometimes people just kind of forget there&#8217;s a human being back there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re humans. Everyone be nice. Yeah. I don&#8217;t know that part of running a release definitely was surprising to me. My first release that I ran was 5.0 and…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:20:31] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, wow!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:20:32]</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Yeah, it was, like, that was  2018. And then I became the executive director at the top of 2019. And I distinctly remember one core chat where I showed up and just was like the most transparent, vulnerable person we&#8217;ve ever experienced in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not true. We have very vulnerable people in the project and very transparent people, but I told everyone like, there are a million of you and one of me, and it&#8217;s kind of terrifying that you&#8217;re leaping on me in this—like you&#8217;re scaring me a lot right now. And that was quite a thing to say to like, all these… it&#8217;s terrifying! Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:21:12] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love when you see that type of vulnerability in the project. I think it takes… it takes a degree of comfort and familiarity with the project to even be able to admit to that. And to me, that&#8217;s a real sign of growth in the project. Like when I first started contributing, I don&#8217;t think I ever would have just said, like, ‘How is the feature supposed to work? I have no idea.’ That&#8217;s something that I say all the time now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>*Laughter*</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know, that is completely fine and more than okay. It&#8217;s a massive project. There are folks who have done deep thinking about a feature over the course of years. You know, and there are experts who can help shed light on various problems that maybe you just haven&#8217;t had a chance to dive into yet and really understand the nuances of yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the amazing thing about open source is that you can lean on folks who do have expertise in that particular area. You&#8217;re not expected to be an expert-expert in every single domain. It&#8217;s okay to say, I don&#8217;t really have a good idea or a good concept of this feature. I don&#8217;t have a good feeling for it. What do other folks think?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:22:24] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even people who have been in the project for a long time, decade plus, still say that all the time. You know, or you might just say, like, I have a really rough idea of how this works, are other people seeing this the same way? Or did other people have a different, you know, mental picture of how this might work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if, sometimes it feels like you&#8217;re over-communicating, it&#8217;s really helpful because often people do have really dramatically different ideas about how a feature might take shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:22:49] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I hope that&#8217;s one of the things that we never lose in the project. Like we are an old, old project now and we support a bunch of the web with a tiny, tiny group of people compared to the amount of the web that we support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I hope that we always have that opportunity as senior leaders, which I am, and all of our upcoming leaders to all of us, just at some point, be like, can we stop the train? I don&#8217;t understand. I don’t understand that. Um, and not necessarily feel that that has made us a worse contributor. Cause I think that it&#8217;s when we are transparent about our lack of understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s when we have the opportunity to make what we&#8217;re offering to the world more solid and always better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:23:35] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it. I think it&#8217;s the, one of the most lovely things about the WordPress community. There&#8217;s really low judgment around those types of questions and people are really inclusive and more than happy to take a moment to explain something to you or shed some light on an issue you might not have thought that much about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s one of the best things you can always reach out for help. And folks are always willing to provide guidance or context or even historical information about, you know, whether it&#8217;s been tried in the past or previous explorations and that sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:24:10] </p>\n\n\n\n<p> All right. Well, that covers all of my questions for you. Do you have a final thought about the release that you would like to share with everyone you don&#8217;t have to, if you don&#8217;t want to, not everyone has like a final sign off.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:24:25] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. One of the things I&#8217;m most excited about for this 6.0 release is all of the improvements around design tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And these are just small improvements around a ton of different things, like the color panel, border controls, gap support, typography options, flexible container blocks, etc. These are the types of tools that are a designer&#8217;s dream. You know, they really make the difference between being able to make a really crisp, finished looking final product and having something that&#8217;s a little rough around the edges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a designer, like those are the things that your eye goes straight towards. And all of these nuanced new tools, they really allow designers to have that fine detailed control to create really pixel perfect sites. And I think that&#8217;s something that, you know, myself and a lot of others on the design team are just so beyond excited about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:25:25]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. Well, Channing, thank you so much for joining us today on the WordPress Briefing; it has been an absolute delight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:25:32] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:25:41] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it is time, woohoo, for the small list of big things. My favorite part of this podcast, that&#8217;s not true. I have a lot of things that I love about this podcast. I just, in particular love being able to share like three things that are coming up in the next couple of weeks that everybody should be aware of. And I really particularly like the list I have this week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First as of today, we are two weeks away from WordSesh. If you&#8217;re looking forward to your first in-person WordPress event, but feel like you could use a little foundation information, a little bit of a WordPress primer, then this event has a lot of excellent thought leaders in the project that you can learn from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for more practical or hands-on opportunities, uh, you can also check out social learning spaces. All of those are free for anyone. So I will include links to both of them in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:26:30]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, as of today, we are four weeks away from WordCamp Europe. This is one of our flagship events. So it also includes a contributor day, which I encourage you to look into. If you have never heard of one before. I will be there to meet some of the contributors that have joined the project since the end of 2019. And hopefully, I will see you there as well. If you&#8217;ve never heard of a contributor day, then I&#8217;ll include a link to the beginner&#8217;s guide to contributions, a little talk that I gave in 2017 in the show notes that should help you get your bearings or at the very least know what questions to ask yourself to figure out if a contributor day is right for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing as of today, it has been one week since <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/iandunn/\">Ian Dunn</a> and the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/\">Meta</a> developers… Um, that sounds like a band… Ian Dunn and the Meta developers connected the props channel in the community Slack to WordPress.org profile activity. I&#8217;m really excited about this. It&#8217;s the first in a long list of changes that are part of a larger project to credit more non-code contributions, more contributions that are not specific to a major release or event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also to set us up to be able to provide more quality checks and balances for our growing Five for the Future program. If you&#8217;ve not been over there lately, if you&#8217;re not super sure what I&#8217;m talking about, there&#8217;s a link to the discussion post that we had about it, but also you can wander right over into the Making WordPress Slack and check out the props channel to just kind of see a running list of contributors that people are really grateful for. Which, frankly, if you ever are having a bad day, that is a wonderful place to just kind of wander in and see all of the positive vibes that people are sending around to each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, yeah, so the props channel, is always good. Uh, and that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 02 May 2022 13:03:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Santana Inniss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"Do The Woo Community: devlife_snippet: Building in Two Worlds of Open Source, Joomla and WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=71531\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://dothewoo.io/building-joomla-and-wordpress-products-extensions/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:412:\"<p>Being in the open source space, the beginning and the end can happen with moving between platforms.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/building-joomla-and-wordpress-products-extensions/\">devlife_snippet: Building in Two Worlds of Open Source, Joomla and WordPress</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 02 May 2022 09:35:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"BuddyPress: BP Rewrites 1.1.0 Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=324472\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://buddypress.org/2022/05/bp-rewrites-1-1-0-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:849:\"<p>Immediately available is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/bp-rewrites.1.1.0.zip\">BP Rewrites 1.1.0</a>.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg 13.1 version, New Zealand, inner blocks in an interesting work in progress with our special guest, Glen Davies. I&#8217;m Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and a WordPress developer advocate. And I&#8217;m here with my lovely co-host Mary Job. She&#8217;s also a WordPress advocate, works as support engineer at Paid Membership Pro and is a community organizer at wpafrica.org. And today we also have a special guest. I&#8217;m thrilled to welcome Glen Davies to our show. He&#8217;s from New Zealand, a JavaScript engineer on the Gutenberg project and the release lead for the Gutenberg plugin 13.1 version. Good evening, Mary, top of the morning to you, Glen. And thank you both for joining. How are you today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Good, thanks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m fine too Birgit. Nice to see you. Nice to meet you, Glen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Yeah, likewise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome. Awesome. So Glen, before we go into the weeds of the plugin release and the rest of the show, I want to ask you a couple of questions about your WordPress journey and about your work on the gallery block. And maybe you can briefly tell us how you came to WordPress and automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Guess I came to automattic and then to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, okay. The other way around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: I had used WordPress quite a few years ago. I was an IT manager for a not for profit for a few years and they needed a blogging platform. So I installed WordPress for them. But that was mostly from a tinkering setting up point of view rather than development. They didn&#8217;t really need a lot of development, just a pretty simple blog. Prior to that, I&#8217;d done quite a bit of PHP development. I developed an open source learning management system for a university. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve dealt with LMSs, you&#8217;ve probably heard of something called Moodle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Yeah, yeah. But that wasn&#8217;t the LMS I developed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It was similar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Yeah. Well, the one I developed, I probably say mine was the beta max to Moodle&#8217;s VHS. So Moodle sort of&#8230; Moodle got the community and mine never did. At one point I said to the university they were wasting their money paying me to be the sole developer of an open source LMS. They should really use Moodle instead. So I sort of did myself out of a job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was ready for a change. I did IT management for a while and that&#8217;s when I first encountered WordPress. Decided that IT management wasn&#8217;t really for me. So I went back to development for a couple of big corporates. But got a bit sick of the commute and the crammed office spaces. I think the last office I was in there was a person a meter and a half that side and the meter and a half that side and a meter behind me was other three people. You had to say, &#8220;excuse me&#8221; when you pushed your chair out to go to the bathroom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I had a bit of a look around about three years ago for remote work positions and Automattic came up and looking through the Automattic CRE, just the whole philosophy and culture really, rang true for me. So I took a punt and applied and managed to get a position. That was, yeah, about three years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, wow. Yeah. So that is in the middle of the new development of Gutenberg pretty much. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Yeah. It was some of the early releases was sort of going out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That kind of brings up the question that I had, or that a lot of people had, is how do you migrate or how do you become, get, from a PHP developer to a JavaScript developer or a mixed to, for the Gutenberg blocks and custom blocks and all that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Yeah, for me, it wasn&#8217;t&#8230; Cause I said years ago I did a lot of PHP, but then when I came back to development, I went almost straight into just JavaScript front end. It was just a big learning curve of diving in. So for me coming to Automattic and WordPress, it was almost the reverse I had to go back from doing JavaScript to some PHP stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh yeah. Okay. I get that. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Did you have contact with other people in the workers community in New Zealand?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: No. Cause unfortunately I started 2019. I spent the first eight or nine months just really getting to grips with WordPress and then of course COVID hit. So I&#8217;m hoping this year, New Zealand, like most countries has opened up quite a bit. So hopefully there&#8217;ll be some local WordPress events I can get along to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, hopefully. I hope that for you too. Yeah. Cause you&#8217;re probably not coming to work in Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: No, not this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. There&#8217;s actually a good friend of the Gutenberg Times, so to speak, Ellen Bauer. She is the owner of the Elmer Studio and with her significant other Manuel they have quite a few themes in the&#8230; And she&#8217;s was one of the early adopters of Gutenberg as well as the block themes. I&#8217;m not quite sure how far away you were, but yeah. She&#8217;s definitely, she migrated to New Zealand a long time ago. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Yeah, no. It would be good to catch up with some local events this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well keeping the fingers crossed that that&#8217;s possible. So you and me, Glen, we collaborated a little bit on the working on the gallery block of trying to figure out how to let the community know that they were be a change. And you converted the first version, which came out 2018, had not particularly been developed much after that. And it now uses a single image block within blocks and it came to WordPress school in 5.9 in January. So it&#8217;s such a richer experience and has all the features that the image block has, is now coming to gallery block and you can kind of change each image or&#8230; And also you have the styles for it. I had the feeling that the journey wasn&#8217;t particularly easy one, from especially around backwards compatibility blocks and deprecating blocks. What did you learn and what advice would you give developers working on version two for the list and the quotes and the developers building custom blocks?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Well, I learned that it&#8217;s not as easy as it looks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s life for you, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: There were a whole list of open issues of people saying, &#8220;oh, we need the gallery to be able to do this.&#8221; And, &#8220;in an image in a gallery, we need to be able to do that.&#8221; And I sort of looked and thought, well, you can already do that on the image block. So why aren&#8217;t we just wrapping the image blocks rather than&#8230; Cause there was almost a whole lot of copy and pasted code to duplicate stuff between images and the gallery. I thought I might as well have a go and see whether we could use inner blocks. Which the initial setup was pretty straightforward, but yeah, there were a whole lot of gotchas in actually getting it to run properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then when we looked at the backwards compatibility, the main issue we had was with the mobile app. So the big learning was just how different the Gutenberg editor in the mobile app is from the web editor. In terms of the fact that you have a whole lot of different versions of the editor out running in people&#8217;s apps that haven&#8217;t been upgraded. And currently the editor has no way of knowing what to do with a block it hasn&#8217;t encountered before. So in the mobile app, it would get the gallery that had inner blocks and think there&#8217;s no content, cause it didn&#8217;t recognize blocks. And Android quite nicely, or it was thought it was being quite nice in auto saving as soon as it opened it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Overriding whatever&#8217;s there, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Yeah. Would say, oh, it&#8217;s a gallery. There&#8217;s nothing in it, save. And it would lose all the people&#8217;s images. There was a lot of working with the mobile team to work out, how do we stage deploying the new version so that people on the mobile app don&#8217;t lose their data. Yeah, one of the big learnings was just the issues with compatibility. In the meantime, Dennis, I think you had Dennis on the podcast a few weeks ago. He&#8217;s done quite a bit of work to make the editor a bit more robust to be able to cope with blocks it doesn&#8217;t recognize. So rather than just losing the data, just say, hang on, I don&#8217;t recognize this. I&#8217;ll just ignore it for now and leave it as it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Just display what I have and then yeah, the plain HDML. So yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: So hopefully it&#8217;ll slowly start to ease, but I know the quote block people have the&#8230; The developers that have converted quotes to inner blocks have had the same issue with mobile. Cause they&#8217;ve had to stage the deployment so that the mobile versions don&#8217;t lose the data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Interesting. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Yeah. One of the other big learnings was just how well the whole community works together. It&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s&#8230; It was a pretty big change but it wasn&#8217;t too hard to get the people that needed to be involved, involved, and work through the issues together. And then paying the likes of yourselves to say, we need to let the community know. And knowing that you took that bit on board and paying the relevant developers and let them know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And it was interesting to see that most of the theme developers that are plugin developers and also theme developers that I reached out to, they already were aware that there&#8217;s something coming and there were testing quite a bit on the Gutenberg plugin. Yeah. So when it came to 5.9, there were no surprises on that, not that particular on that part. Well, but we were not able to reach all of the people, but I think it was a good chunk of it. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Yeah. I held my breath when the 5.9 release went out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Say that again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: I held my breath when the 5.9 release went out. I thought, oh, I hope this is going to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: It&#8217;s a pretty block. There&#8217;s a lot of people use gallery blocks. So it was a bit nerve racking pushing out such a major change, but it seems to have gone reasonably smoothly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. The backwards compatibility and on the desktop version or on the web version. Yeah. That was quite nicely. I was really pleasantly surprised that what I can do in addition what I was doing already on the gallery block. So it was a very pleasant surprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yeah. I think I have a question for Glen if you don&#8217;t mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Yeah, sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: As you said you came into WordPress three years ago. Would you say coming from all that kind of development into WordPress, would you say WordPress has a steep learning curve or was it like smooth?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Yeah. Reasonably steep learning curve. Cause although it&#8217;s Java script and react, which I&#8217;d used before, there&#8217;s a reasonable amount of complexity in Gutenberg. It&#8217;s a pretty impressive project when you look at the depth and the breadth of it, what it&#8217;s actually doing. Even having worked on it for three years, there&#8217;s some parts of Gutenberg that are just a black box to me. Yeah. There&#8217;s parts I haven&#8217;t had to touch and I&#8217;ve got no idea what they&#8217;re doing. And if I had to actually do some debugging in that area, there&#8217;s quite often quite a bit of work to think what&#8217;s actually happening here, what&#8217;s going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But having said that, think it wraps really well some of that complexity. And then allows the block developers to do an awful lot of fairly clever stuff with a minimal amount of work. For instance, the new block supports are fairly impressive. Previously, if you wanted to have borders and background colors and text colors, you had to copy and paste a whole lot of code. Now it&#8217;s just a matter of adding a few flags to your JSON file and suddenly your block has borders and background color and text color.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. That&#8217;s pretty impressive. I really love the development on the theme JSON file and all the configuration that goes in there. And it works very well with classic themes as well. So it&#8217;s a really good way how that works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: It&#8217;s sort of an interesting mix of complexity and simplicity. There&#8217;s some really complex stuff going on in the background, but it&#8217;s been wrapped quite well to a nice, simple API for block developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Do you have another question, Mary?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: No, no, no. I was just thinking how impressive that is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, let&#8217;s get started with the rest of the show. It&#8217;s so glad you&#8217;re here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have one announcement that just made it in. If you want to test the features that are in Gutenberg 13.1, head over to the latest call for testing from the FSE, from the full site editing program. And it&#8217;s called &#8216;Rallying Recipe Reviewers&#8217;. And this call for testing focuses on, on taking a few blocks amongst on the list view in this and the quote blocks in the second version and practically spin it up with fun for interactive recipe focused site. Where you can customize the commenting experience. And for a very interactive site. The instructions are from Anne McCarthy again. It&#8217;s the 14th of these testing calls and they are very detailed and they get you really into the topic of things. It just was published yesterday. You have about three weeks to comment on this and try it out. Of course, as always, the link to the post will be in the show notes. And yeah. So that&#8217;s the announcement for today. What else do we have?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Oh, we have community contributions. So our fellow WordPress podcast Nathan Wrigley over at Jukebox podcast talked to Aki Hamano who is a plugin and freelance developer from Japan. Hamano also has some great blocks in the repository. Three years ago, he created a rich text expansion plugin when Gutenberg only had rudimentary color spacing and controls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he also has a flexible table block. So he also has this amazing block plugin, piano block, which I actually just tried today and it was fun. I didn&#8217;t want to leave the post editor. What this does is it adds a musical instrument to your editor screen and you can take a break from content version and make some music in between. And this block doesn&#8217;t show anything on the front end, which makes it a really fun project. Have you tried that plugin Birgit or Glen? I thought it was fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I have not tried it but Justin Tadlock actually wrote a separate blog about it a month or so ago, blog post about it. And he has a video where he tried to do a music thing. And I&#8217;m not saying which one, because you might want to go there and kind of try it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: What about you, Glen? Have you tried it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: No, I haven&#8217;t tried it. I did see the WP Tavern article about it. Yeah, I must give it a go. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yeah. I saw today and I didn&#8217;t want to stop playing. I felt like a genius. You know those saying, is it all work and no play makes Jack do&#8230; I remember that when I saw that I was like, ah, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And sometimes when you&#8217;re stuck on developing or trying to write something and you distract yourself and you come back, it&#8217;s coming there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yeah, it makes very profit break time. Because there are times when you are stuck, like, okay, it&#8217;s not working. And then I just want to take a walk. I mean I could take a break and then play some piano.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: On the podcast, Nathan and Aki also talked about what the developer journal learning and building blocks was like. As always, we&#8217;re going to put the link to this and the show notes so you can always read. It was quite entertaining listening to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released &#8211; WordPress 6.0 Beta 3 and Gutenberg 13.1</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Great, yeah. So the brings us to the section what&#8217;s released? And so we had two releases. One was WordPress Beta 3. Do you want to talk about it Mary or?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Oh yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: The Beta 3 release comes with a few bug fixes that was discovered in the previous betas. It now has the power down version of Workfront API. I believe we&#8217;ve talked about this in past episodes. Which allows team developers to register team star versions, including typography with their team.JSON file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. We talked the last episode where it wasn&#8217;t clear if the fonts API actually would make it into 6.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yes. So the team is working tirelessly to bring all the notes to the field guide and least order interesting changes in time for the release candidate that will be coming on the third of May. And just in case you&#8217;re wondering, WordPress 6.0 is scheduled to come to you, WordPress on the 24th of May, 2002. I&#8217;m quite excited to try it out and see what new exciting features it brings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So WordPress in 6.0 is not as big as 5.9, but it has a lot of exciting new features. Anne McCarthy also published a video with highlights on YouTube if you want to check that out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And we talked about it two weeks ago and what our favorite features are. Glen, do have a favorite feature for the 6.0 version?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Can&#8217;t think of anything off the top of my head. There was so much 5.9 and I&#8217;ve been doing a bit of background stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I really like, and I haven&#8217;t looked at it before, but I&#8217;ve found that there are actually quite some writing experience improvements in there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Yeah, actually, now that you mentioned that the partial block selection is probably it, yeah. There&#8217;s been so many times over the last few years where that&#8217;s come up as you can&#8217;t select partial blocks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. If, if you want over two paragraphs or something like that, and want to have something italic or bold that is half a sentence above and the other half below, you couldn&#8217;t do that and it&#8217;s now possible and you can do all of it. That&#8217;s one of the things. And the other one is the double bracket short code to have a list of all the posts or pages that are on your site to link to it, to do inner links. That is actually quite nicely done. But we will talk about it when it&#8217;s out again. You will find quite a few things will be published right around that. The about page and then marketing is working on their releases for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also had the Gutenberg 13.1 release. It was released on yesterday, also April 27th, and release lead Glen Davies. Thank you so much. How is that release experience when you do it as a developer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Oh, it was my first time at it so I was sort of a newbie. Luckily the documentation&#8217;s pretty straightforward and I was sort of lucky that it was a reasonably small release. Because 13.0 was the release that went into WordPress six. So doing the release, that&#8217;s going to go into the WordPress, call releases, usually a big job. I was lucky I got the one just after that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I think only a few PRs were backboarded to 6.0. There were still some buck fixes or so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So what brings&#8230; We have definitely someone had enhancements coming, even it&#8217;s a small release, but it&#8217;s the design tools for borders. There&#8217;s a new border control component in the block support thing. So it can also be configured with the theme.JSON for individual blocks, like the column blocks you can have in your theme.JSON settings for the blocks. You can say a standard, a variation, on the border configuration, which is really nice. There is also for the duotone. There are two things for duotone on&#8230; There&#8217;s a new icon for the filter on the image block. And the other one was that the duotone&#8217;s now render in the site editor when you use it on the placeholder. So if you have a featured image placeholder or other media and text placeholder or something like that and use the duotone for it will show you in the editor as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: The block library also had some enhancements. I&#8217;m excited about the comments, the fact that you can now style the comments area, because I know in the past, when I first started creating WordPress sites people would tell you, ah, no, the comments section is too boring. Can you like make it brighter? Or can you change? So this is actually interesting because you don&#8217;t have to use third party. Well, you can still use them if you want. But having it in Chrome means that you don&#8217;t have to go allowed to start a comments area on blog post. The category section also had an enhancement. There&#8217;s now an option to show or how I entered categories previously in the past. If her category has no post, it was eating. But now you can now choose to show or hide categories that are empty. So that&#8217;s also interesting. Yeah. This particular one, this, the styles, this enhancement styles. I didn&#8217;t quite get this. You mentioned duotone tone earlier. Can you expand on this one? Because I tried reading about it, but I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what it was referring to here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. You can do a preset for the dual tone in the theme.JSON. so when you have a duotone filter for the image, you can set that with a theme.JSON is and reference foreground and secondary for instance, since colors. So you can. That only that is available. A lot of people have real stomach ache when they envision that people who edit a site can come up with all different kind of crazy combination for the duotone or for the gradient. Having a way to standardize that for a whole site that is now in the theme.JSON You can switch off the duotone settings then for the editor, but still have duotone settings for the images if you allow that. Does it make sense?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yes. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay, good. Yeah. Some on the other styles changes, there were all a little bit more cosmetic. Do you have anything that you want to point out there Glen or Mary?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Probably just highlighting again, what you&#8217;ve already mentioned that the borders, it&#8217;s great that there&#8217;s now the ability to set each of the borders separately. Both in the U both in the UI and in the theme.JSON.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Did you test this specifically as well? Because I have a question on it and there was a question that&#8217;s actually on the release post, is there a way to also get some styles in there, like a double or outset or dotted line in that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Yeah. So you can change it to solid dotted. Adding it to columns is quite good I think, cause it&#8217;s quite a good showcase of it. Because columns is an obvious place where you only want one border as a division between each of the columns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: So I think it was quite a good block to get that into to sort of showcase 101 borders and its specific edge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Accessibility</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Absolutely, yeah. And then there were also quite a few changes, accessibility improvements, that included the resolve around the focus loss problems that have been experienced for the installing blocks, from the directory or creating pages from a link. Or there were quite a few situations where all of a sudden the block editor would lose focus and a screenwriter wouldn&#8217;t know where to be and how to handle that. And so that there have been quite a few fixes there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Documentation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And then documentation, what I saw was that you fixed some of the&#8230; Was it in this release that you, Glen, wrote about the deprecated locks that you fix up the documentation for that. Was this for this release?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: No, I think there was a couple of releases ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Okay. But that definitely helps some of the developers to figure out how to deprecate the versioning for static blocks you, which is still a little bit cumbersome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Yeah. That was one big learning from the gallery block that forced me to work out how deprecations work. And that&#8217;s slightly different there how duplications and migrations work in software in general.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I wish they had kind of written a blog post about your learning and the frustrations about it because I think that&#8217;s what a lot of developers have in the community as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Yeah. Maybe I might, might take the time to do that. Yeah. Our team&#8217;s set up a blog to try and document some of our experiences. So perhaps I&#8217;ll take the time to go back and go through that. There is some discussion about improving the duplication migration process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. But there&#8217;s nothing yet kind of that surface that trade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: No, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s an issue and there&#8217;s a bit of discussion about it. An agreement that&#8217;s a little bit confusing,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: A little bit confusing. I think that&#8217;s the understatement of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You&#8217;re not English, are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. No, but there were quite a few documentation updates in this release. one was about the new ancestor property for the block meta data. And the other one was about the inserter argument for the patterns where you can hide patterns that are with your theme to set the inserter setting to false, then users won&#8217;t be able to find the pattern in your, in the inserter, but you can still use it on tablet and tablet parts. And that is documented, it&#8217;s also documented the updates for the theme.JSON file has been updated as well as documentation around the individual block locking sections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you are interested in that and want to do that&#8217;s the state of the art kind of on how that is, check out the documentation and follow the links.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Code Quality</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So in the release post to get to that code quality, is there anything that&#8217;s stood out to you that you feel, oh, that&#8217;s a neat thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: No, probably more on the testing side of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The testing, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Which is sort of related to code quality and that&#8217;s the migration to using playwright.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. How is that going?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: That&#8217;s making good progress and it&#8217;s going to make the writing at the end to end test and debugging of them Significantly easier. So it&#8217;ll be good ones that&#8217;s completed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It would be really interesting to see kind of a primer on how to use playwright and how to write the test. Not only for of course for the Gutenberg project, but definitely for contributors on the Gutenberg project, but definitely also if you want to use it also for their own project yeah. To how to get into that testing part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Yeah. Which I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;ll be coming once once the the whole migration project&#8217;s finalized and underway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I can imagine there&#8217;s quite a foundational foundational work that needs to be done for that can be migrated. Totally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that was&#8230; So anything we forgot? Kind of&#8230; There&#8217;s some developer experience for the local environment. Now you can have a environment and core environment variable, and I&#8217;m thinking that&#8217;s probably about the version. And then the create block scaffolding tool has been updated to fix all the warnings and errors that are reported during the scaffolding and validation. So it&#8217;s all a little nicer now. All right. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that concludes our session of what was released, or the session part.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And we can now go and discuss what&#8217;s active in development, what&#8217;s work in progress and what people can look forward to. One is APR called a visualizer for the padding. Riad is working on that. So when you are changing the padding for a block, it shows you a visualize representation, a visual representation of that, how it looks in the editor around the block. If you say 20, how does that look? 20 pixels or one for that side. Because there&#8217;s a lot of&#8230; There&#8217;s padding, there is margin. And then there is block gaps and all those three things, if you are using that in the side bar, can be confusing. Where did I change things? And if you have a visualizer, it&#8217;s very obvious on how you change things and those changes are easily then replicated or even controlled. So that&#8217;s definitely something to look forward to. I&#8217;m not quite sure how far that is. Definitely&#8230;. Oh, it has been merged. So this will come in a 13.2 version, Gutenberg version. And it&#8217;s the same version that will have the persistent preferences and user meta. And that was horah on Twitter when one of the developers discovers that that is coming, we have all been waiting for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What am I talking about? I&#8217;m talking about the welcome guide, popping up on all kinds of different situations. When you have a new browser, you have a new computer, you have just changed the browser settings. And here comes welcome to the block editor. You have been using it for four years and it still wants to welcome you. It was kind of an annoying thing. It&#8217;s also&#8230; That&#8217;s one of the obvious things, but the other part is also your settings for the top toolbar. When you are in the editor and you go from block to block, there&#8217;s a block toolbar. And sometimes that&#8217;s a little bit disconcerting for content editors. You can actually glue it up to the top, through the settings menu. And it was also just stored in local storage on the browser and you had to do it again over and over as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now this is changing. With 13.2, those settings will be stored in the user meta data, in the database. It will remember. You go away and you come back. It will remember. And it&#8217;s yeah&#8230; Quite a few people who say, okay, it&#8217;s about time that it comes. I know why it was a little bit delayed because these are settings for the editor and there are editors. There&#8217;s a widget editor, there&#8217;s a site editor, there&#8217;s a template editor, there&#8217;s a block editor and a post editor. There are a lot of editors that first needed be unified before you could actually standardize the persistence for it. But yeah, three years ago there wasn&#8217;t a widget editor. There wasn&#8217;t a site editor. So back then, I think the developers didn&#8217;t have enough information to make that a good way to start out. So waiting was far probably a good decision to not get into technical depth with backwards compatibility promises and all that. Yes. But we&#8217;re all happy about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Gooding has the story already WP Tavern. We share the links, of course, on the show notes. And the last thing that I have&#8230; So there is also&#8230; So when you use a theme and you edit it with the global styles or with the styles thing, all the information is stored in the database. Only when you export it, all the changes will come into the theme.JSON. In the works is a safe theme edits from the site editor to the theme files. When it&#8217;s in a so-called developer mode, making it a little bit easier for designers to visually update a theme and then have that, and then update the theme files per se, be it the JSON file or template power or template files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it can be export or can be reused. But it doesn&#8217;t have to be an export. And then there will just be a safe button and you can switch it off with a development flag mode true or false. That&#8217;s also in the works. We will share the PRS for it. So you can comment on it or chime in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Channing Ritter has updated the design share on the make block for design, and you will see some things that they&#8217;re working on with the Figma files or Figma links. One of them is also it&#8217;s the element state exploration. How can the interface look when you want to change the hover or active setting for elements like a menu or a link or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mel Joyce says up the did some work in Block Patterns in Figma. There&#8217;s also a discussion of revising the global style panels. What I like is, or what I really pleasantly surprised on how far the work has been done, is the design for documentation and handbook pages as Stella Raella has that, has the Figma file shared with the design team. And it&#8217;s all in the design of the new news theme. I don&#8217;t know if you saw the news scene webpress.org/news has had a recent design and now all the designers are working on replicating that for the rest of workforce.org and make.org. So it&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anything else? Glen, do you want to&#8230; What are you working on now? Is it that you, the race is out and you&#8217;re working on certain projects?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies:</em> The team that I&#8217;m currently on, we&#8217;re working on global styles and design tools. So the big project we are currently working on is something called the style engine. Which is sort of a way of trying to bring together all the different styling elements of a block. Because at the moment it&#8217;s a bit&#8230; The styles in quite a few different places, particularly with static blocks, There are some that actually are applied to the static content, there&#8217;s class names that are applied, there&#8217;s inline styles that are applied. The sort of Nirvana would be that the actual static block content had very little styling actually saved within it. There would just be some meta information and the styles are then applied at the server. And it could be a lot clearer than about which styles of output with the page based on what block content was there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the moment, there&#8217;s a lot of redundant style content has to go with the page to cover all the possibilities of blocks that might be there. So there&#8217;s a lot of work around trying to rationalize that and say, well, let&#8217;s only output the CSS that&#8217;s actually needed for this particular page content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I know that some theme developers are really having a hard time with a few block changes. Every release there is a change that they have to update their themes and either take away classes or find classes. All of a sudden it&#8217;s all overwritten, both important kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Yeah, there&#8217;s some discussions going on. There&#8217;s been some really good input from theme authors about what the difficulties they&#8217;re having. So that&#8217;s feeding in really well to this around the style engine and there&#8217;s all those ongoing questions about backwards compatibility and the API. It&#8217;s a reasonably big project. At the moment there&#8217;s sort of no definite timeframes. We have the basic style engine in place, but then we&#8217;ve got to go through the process of how do we move all of the existing blocks to use this new way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Styles. Yeah. This new way and what to do with the old ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Because the static blocks, they don&#8217;t update themselves. You need to touch them before they update themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s a needed project, but it&#8217;s a big project and it&#8217;s a matter of working out how do we stage it, rather than go away for two years and work on the style engine. By the time everything&#8217;s moved on. It&#8217;s the usual thing with software development. What are the little pieces we can do to actually keep this thing moving and release pieces along the way create a massive project that never actually completes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, no, I get it. But it&#8217;s good. I know there was some discussion and we had also discussed it here with the proposal from Mark Road Wiley. I think he did some foundational thinking about that and there was quite a good summary, but also the ideas that he had in terms of how that could be input or what a theme developer would need. That I think that post really informed about that to make it as close as possible for how theme developers were going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Yeah. That generated some really good discussion. And what we&#8217;ve done is split that up into about four different areas. Because there was some quite of distinct parts within that. So we&#8217;ve tried to split that into separate issues to deal with each of them separately. So hopefully some progress will be made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: And coming releases on this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;m looking forward to that to maybe write about things that work. I have some deaf notes that I could wrangle about soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. So I think we are at the end of the show. Glen, if somebody wants to get in touch with you and wants to reach you, what would be the best way to do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: At glendavies.nz</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. And you also&#8230; Are you often on the WebPress slack community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Oh yeah. Yeah. All WebPress slack. Same. Glendavies.nz. See me there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay. Thank you</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Before we let Glen go, I hope you don&#8217;t mind my asking. So my question again is on your background. I hope you don&#8217;t mind my asking. In my part of the world, we have a lot of people who are learning development actively. It&#8217;s like an escape over here. &#8220;Okay, if I can&#8217;t get a normal day job, maybe I can learn development and make something out of that.&#8221; If you were to meet somebody who is starting to learn development, is in their first or second year of learning, would you recommend WordPress development to such a person? Is this something you would say, okay, maybe you could actually build a career in WordPress development? Do you think that&#8217;s…? Because people are very skeptic hearing some WordPress developers like, what&#8217;s a WordPress developer. It&#8217;s not common. It&#8217;s not like everywhere as opposed to other developments languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Glen Davies</em>: Yeah. I definitely recommend it particularly the likes of the Gutenberg project. So if you can get involved in the project and pick up some small issues, there&#8217;s some reasonably simple things that come through. And if you can start putting up some PRs with some simple fixes, a reasonably easy way to get into a development community. And then if you start getting some of your PRs accepted. It&#8217;s a pretty friendly and accepting developer community. There&#8217;s some other developer communities where you might put up some simple PRs and get lambasted for doing things the wrong way. But from my experience, you&#8217;re not going to get that in the WordPress community. You&#8217;re just going to generally get help and support. So I think that there would definitely be a way to actually get into development in a bigger way. Plus it&#8217;s real life and it&#8217;s a real project. So can&#8217;t help but improve your CV or your resume if you can say, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve been actively involved in this project for the last year and here&#8217;s the 10 PRs that I&#8217;ve had accepted and merged.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s a very good question. Thank you, Mary. And I like the answer. There&#8217;s actually a label in the Gutenberg repository that says &#8216;Good First Bugs&#8217;. So scouting through those or just pulling up and see if something moves you or something you were interested in is definitely, yeah. Try to pick that up. There are also other ways to start contributing to WordPress. I always have to say that it doesn&#8217;t have to be code. But if you&#8217;re a developer code is definitely one thing. But it&#8217;s also could be testing quite a bit. So there are also labels says &#8220;needs testing&#8221; means, okay, we need some more reports and what could configuration or something like that. Is that reproducible, especially for the bug reports. So the developer who picks that up has a better inkling on how to attack that. That&#8217;s also a good way to get started if you don&#8217;t know the project yet. I think doing it from the user point and tested for some bugs is definitely a good way to get in there. Yeah, definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Anything else? How can people reach you, Mary? Anything from your side that you want to announce and let people know, our listeners know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Not a lot. We recently had a diverse speaker training group, all the meet up for the leaguers, some citizen in Nigeria, and also here. That was interesting. They had a lot of good feedback. Like I said, we&#8217;re actively trying to grow the WP Africa community. We want, I personally want to get to know people who are doing WordPress on this continent and maybe we can have chat that wordcam.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And if you are listening from Africa and you want to be part of it, WPafrica.org is the website with all information about it. You can also get Mary on Twitter. MaryoJob is the Twitter handle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, the show notes will be published on Gutenbergtimes.com/podcast. This is episode 66.

This month we feature a Indian-based WordPress developer and long term contributor on how it helped her find a career and a local and global community to belong to.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"515\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/meher-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C515&ssl=1\" alt=\"Meher pictured against the backdrop of a window overlooking trees \" class=\"wp-image-12728\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WordPress is an inspiration to Meher Bala, a frontend web developer and community builder from India. From using the software as a basic website tool to helping entrepreneurs and good causes around the world fulfill their aspirations, she has overcome personal barriers and now aims to inspire others.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher found her vocation and learned new skills through WordPress. She also discovered a way to encourage other women to consider careers in IT.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Opening the doors to a career in technology</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a child, Meher was diagnosed with dyslexia (difficulty in reading the written word) and dyscalculia (difficulty in comprehending numbers and mathematical functions). With the support of her parents and a tutor, she was able to overcome this learning obstacle. She developed coping techniques and a determination to work to overcome challenges as they appeared later in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In school, she got an opportunity to replace one subject with computer studies as an alternative. This proved to be an eye-opener to future career possibilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She began to research not only what the internet had to offer but also how it worked, including the new and fascinating concepts of email and websites. Her father bought the family’s first desktop computer so she could do her research at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher’s father wanted to turn her love for computers into something that would serve her well in the future. In 2005, he enrolled her in a short computer course from a global IT training provider. The course tutor was so impressed with her performance, she was advised to enroll in a four year software development course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That meant she had studied the software development course alongside her higher education college course. Looking back, she enjoyed the dual challenge of the degree course in commerce, and the experience prepared her well to keep learning software while working as a developer. Within three years, she had learned C#, C, C++, HTML, Java, and .NET. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After graduation, she was in a dilemma to choose between commerce and IT. What to choose? She had a compulsory one-year technology internship to complete, and her choice of focus for that year would prove to be a defining moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2009, on her birthday, Meher was offered an internship. On the first day of the internship, she was introduced to WordPress. Her initial assignment was to change the look and feel of the WordPress dashboard — in just six hours. But there was a problem &#8211; she had never worked with WordPress before!</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;I stared at the whiteboard and thought that task given was impossible and difficult to meet the deadline. I wondered if my boss was joking and did not know then what you could do with WordPress as a developer and how it could slot into your toolbox. It opened my eyes.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><cite>Meher Bala</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher used her research skills to know more about using WordPress. She found a plugin that would help her achieve her task. She met the deadline and it ingrained an interest that she would never lose. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Re-discovering WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Five years after her initial WordPress experience, Meher was assigned to lead an international project in WordPress.&nbsp;She was hesitant — she had lost touch with the CMS during that five years, but the project was a great opportunity to become a team leader and lead from the front.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She decided to update her WordPress skills, relying again on the strength of her research skills and determination. In the process, she also taught her team all about WordPress, inspiring many of those members to continue to develop their WordPress skill set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The success of that project was a pivotal moment for Meher and a new dawn as a developer specializing in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a team lead, Meher soon found it was not possible to always have all the answers straight away. She found internet searches gave practical solutions—but rarely explained the theory behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So she went looking for a WordPress group to help her expand the scope and depth of her knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding the community and its developer learning opportunities </h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"999\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?resize=999%2C667&ssl=1\" alt=\"Meher at WordCamp Nagpur in 2017\" class=\"wp-image-12762\" />Meher enjoying being part of <em>WordCamp Nagpur in 2017</em>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, while browsing Facebook, Meher came across an advertisement for something called WordCamp Mumbai, an event that had taken two days before. She did a little digging to learn what a WordCamp was, and about the people behind it. She took the plunge and joined the WordPress Mumbai Meetup group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her first Meetup experience was not love at first sight. She felt the topics were for advanced users, and the timing late in the evening made it difficult to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a few months later, the Meetup addressed a topic that could help her resolve an issue in one of her current projects. She made the effort to show up and came away with a number of important tips.&nbsp;The speaker had taken the time to speak to individual attendees. When he came to Meher, she took the opportunity to ask a couple of questions about her project issues. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thereafter she went to more Meetups and got to know the people behind this group, just as they started talking about WordCamp Mumbai 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A WordCamp adventure</h2>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcm16.jpg?resize=600%2C800&ssl=1\" alt=\"Meher pictured with the WordCamp Mumbai 2016 sign \" class=\"wp-image-12758\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" />Meher discovering <em>WordCamps in Mumbai in 2016</em>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher expressed interest in being a part of the coming&nbsp; WordCamp Mumbai and started in an entry-level role with basic responsibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, she thought WordCamp was a formal conference with about 100 people. So on the first day of WordCamp Mumbai 2016, she was surprised to see so many WordCamp enthusiasts attending and enjoying such a relaxed and friendly conference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that great experience, Meher went to many more meetups and did more volunteering. She started taking on responsibilities in the coming WordCamps and getting to know the different aspects of the camp.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the following years, at each WordPress, she took up a new role like speaker vetting, sponsors, and volunteer coordination. This allowed her to know more about what an organizer needs to do, from planning to execution, to make WordCamp a successful event.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"900\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?resize=900%2C600&ssl=1\" alt=\"WordCamp Mumbai 2017 group photo of the team\" class=\"wp-image-12765\" />With the team at <em>WordCamp Mumbai in 2017</em>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher is grateful for her WordPress journey which was fostered in the Mumbai community. It has been filled with beautiful surprises.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people ask why she’s chosen to specialize professionally in WordPress, Meher says WordPress is easy to teach a non-technical person, yet it is still highly customizable. Being a WordPress developer has given her the opportunity to work&nbsp; remotely for global web development companies that let her think out of the box. And she learns new skills with every release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The community makes WordPress special</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher says that some of her most memorable WordPress moments have revolved around special friendships, trying new things, and participating in community building.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has let her explore different parts of India, make new friends locally and internationally, and encourage women to be a part of meetup groups and events across India.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Meher’s biggest dreams was to lead WordCamp Mumbai as a lead organizer and show others what could be achieved by working together in open source. In 2019, she did just that and has volunteered at international WordCamps and meetups since.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"515\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=1024%2C515&ssl=1\" alt=\"Meher speaking at WordCamp Mumbai 2019\" class=\"wp-image-12731\" />Taking to the stage at WordCamp Mumbai in 2019\n\n\n\n<p>As part of her enthusiasm for sharing the opportunities WordPress can give people, especially women, she has given time to co-organize two global <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">WordPress Translation month long events</a> and contributor events in India.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher said: “I was first introduced to translation at one of the meetups which was organised to support the WordPress Translation Day. I realized this was another way to support my local communities and bring the power of WordPress to them by contributing in Gujarati and Hindi. I did not imagine I would a few years later be a global organizer for the event itself!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With her commitment to ongoing learning as a developer and to model what she believes about the value and community growth opportunities of open source, Meher has given time and energy to the Marketing Team, where she has been a Team Rep, to the Training Team, and to the Core Team contributing to multiple releases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The developer adventure with WordPress is unlimited</h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>At the start of my software developer journey, I always thought the C++ and Java were the only skills you required to excel in your career. From the time I started exploring WordPress in depth, I realized the potential and the power of WordPress in web development.</p><cite>Meher Bala</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a part of the WordPress community, Meher learned that there is so much more than just building blogs on WordPress. She started exploring different features of WordPress, created her first theme, and eventually specialized as a frontend specialist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher now works as a consultant and front end developer with an international agency specializing in WordPress. Asked what she thought was the best thing about being a WordPress developer, Meher replied: &#8220;Through WordPress, I have an opportunity to build unique out of the box websites and work&nbsp;remotely for global web development companies that encourages you to think out of the box. There is always opportunity to continuously advance my coding skills and learn new techniques with every release.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She believes that there is no limit to where using the software can take you and what you can combine it with to find solutions to projects big and small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you earn a living from WordPress, her advice is from the heart: try to give back to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I am sure you will learn or teach something new and definitely make friends across the world. There is no shame in making mistakes, as you can learn from them and develop your skills further. You can also help others as they build their skills.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher added: “Don’t let the things you find difficult get in the way of your success.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"share-the-stories\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>webcommsat</a>), Larissa Murillo (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>lmurillom</a>), Mary Baum (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>marybaum</a>), Chloé Bringmann (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>cbringmann</a>), and Meg Phillips (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/megphillips91/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>megphillips91</a>) for interviews, writing and image work on this story.

This is an opportunity to learn and grow together. </p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I learned a lot from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status/status/1518994407864684545\">the community discussion on Twitter this week</a> in response to <strong>MemberPress</strong>’s handling of users with lapsed support licenses. The specific question we started from spawned a lot of important tangents, but the main issue is really about limits — or voluntary self-limitation:</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"h-is-it-over-the-line-for-a-commercial-wordpress-plugin-to-respond-to-a-lapsed-support-license-by-locking-users-out-of-the-plugin-s-admin-screens\"><strong>&#8220;Is it over the line for a commercial WordPress plugin to respond to a lapsed support license by locking users out of the plugin’s admin screens?&#8221;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there in fact a line, a standard of acceptable practice?</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Otto42/status/1519101482943107073\">Yes</a>, lapsed plugins should simply degrade to &#8220;free/basic” features and core business functions for e-commerce, like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Otto42/status/1519101482943107073\">the ability to issue refunds</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NathLussier/status/1519325184615985152\">No</a>, lapsed plugins can completely shut down access to their admin/settings or even quit functioning altogether.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the WordPress Way?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s an old joke in different military branches and other organizations about there being the right way, the wrong way, and the Army (or whatever) way. Our way, the way we do it here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read Jason Coleman\'s <a href=\"https://therealjasoncoleman.com/2022/04/26/the-wordpress-way/\">thoughtful and deeply invested view</a> of The WordPress Way. He defines it as:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;an ever-evolving set of standards and conventions that will change over time, but basically what we mean is that <strong>our code, UI, and UX should be familiar to other WordPress developers and users interacting with our software.</strong>&#8220;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Is that how you define “The WordPress Way?”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>It’s not a sign of a healthy ecosystem if buyers and sellers are seriously at odds with each other.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an important conversation to have. There are significant differences in the ways plugin owners think about and operate their businesses in a tough market in uncertain times. Differences can seem like barriers and conflict-starters, but they are a great opportunity to learn and grow together.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding Common Ground </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I noticed there were a few quiet (and humorous) points of agreement that may seem small, but they\'re important. First, attacking others’ motives is never good, but even <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lesley_pizza/status/1519130905495105536/photo/1\">the least relevant complaint in any marketplace</a> — that buyers are cheap and sellers are greedy — shows what everyone has in common when frustrations run high: the sense that too much is being asked of them. That’s relatable, whoever feels it, but maligning each other\'s motives &#8230; we don\'t do that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can probably all agree it’s not a sign of a healthy ecosystem when buyers and sellers are seriously at odds with each other. That’s not what anyone wants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what are the tough realities and hard questions we need to face to get where we want to be? (Giving and growing — together.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What doesn\'t work? What does? What are the most difficult dilemmas and apparent contradictions? What risks might be taken?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lesley Sim</strong> and others involved in this discussion so far have suggested a good place to start. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lesley_pizza/status/1519332353428299777\">Admit what’s broken and what doesn’t work</a>, what’s not sustainable. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lesley_pizza/status/1519334979846942720\">Take risks expressing challenging ideas</a>. Value and hold <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lesley_pizza/status/1519338304554283013\">all the disagreements and apparent contradictions</a> in mind together. Be kind. Don’t demonize others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No guarantees on outcomes, but it is a start. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><strong>And we’re asking for your involvement! </strong>Consider this a call for papers — and blog posts!

An <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jvmediadesign/status/1519141833452171265\">ethical issue</a>? All of the above? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should we view plugins (that need constant updates and support) as products, services, or something in-between? How do you educate customers to adopt the appropriate view of your software product so renewals for updates make sense?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Which plugin sales tactics work best?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Are aggressive shutdowns of potentially all functionality one of many possible <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lesley_pizza/status/1519129300074926081\">sales models worth trying out</a>? What else hasn\'t been tried much, or at all? How do support license renewals and marketing around them work <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Otto42/status/1519101482943107073\">elsewhere</a> in Open Source? Does it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/williamsba/status/1519285147585159168\">kill off your user base</a> or just <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lesley_pizza/status/1519130650779209728/photo/1\">free riders</a> if you take a very aggressive approach to customer retention?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rickg/status/1519347108653928448\">What if plugin vendors didn’t offer unlimited support with their licenses?</a> Is this problem what we get without a WordPress “app store?” Is there another way to a win for both plugin owners and users?</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><em><em>This is a <strong>Call for Papers</strong> (or even short posts) that advance knowledge and understanding of a thorny issue in the WordPress community and commercial ecosystem.

Originally built by <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://twitter.com/A5hleyRich\" target=\"_blank\">Ashley Rich</a> and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://twitter.com/pixels4lyf\" target=\"_blank\">Lewis Warren</a> and launched in 2018, ReplyBox has struggled to gain a strong foothold in the WordPress ecosystem as a commercial product with no free version, but it has continued growing at a slow rate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great SaaS but the previous owner had capacity issues and had left the app in limbo with no updates and no support,&#8221; Kemp said. &#8220;We saw a number of people talking about wanting to use it and having minor issues, so I approached Ash and offered to take it off his hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve personally used ReplyBox before for my own site (Iconic) and already knew it was a great privacy-focused alternative to Disqus (which riddled my site with ads unknowingly!). Ash had already been looking for a buyer, and as we&#8217;ve worked together before he knew I&#8217;d be a good fit as the new owner.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ReplyBox is positioned as a Disqus alternative product that is faster, more lightweight, and focused on privacy. Kemp said users are often attracted to the design, the ability to use Markdown, social login, and webhooks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system can be embedded on any website, including static HTML pages to add dynamic commenting. It also integrates with WordPress through a connector plugin that is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/replybox/\">available on WordPress.org</a>, which has more than 400 users.  Kemp said the majority of ReplyBox users are using it with WordPress because that is the audience they are best at reaching due to the current and previous owners&#8217; backgrounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The deal closed earlier this month and the ReplyBox team has been focusing on forging new partnerships.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Since taking over, we&#8217;ve seen an uptick in users and have tested compatibility with <a href=\"https://www.strattic.com/\">Strattic</a> &#8211; a static WordPress site generator &#8211; the perfect candidate for ReplyBox,&#8221; Kemp said. &#8220;Joost is using it on his personal blog. We&#8217;ll hopefully be setting up WPMayor with an account, too, for their site. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team has a few preliminary ideas for the upcoming roadmap and is reviewing past and current requests.

Colm actually built some of the first themes for Woo. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following up on Colm, <strong>Ben Ritner</strong> from <strong>KadenceWP</strong> not only shared his journey with blocks and themes but also how he has a very tight focus on WooCoommerce. In addition, he gave us some great insights about <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/focus-blocks-themes-woocommerce/\">the “blockifying” of the WooCommerce product page</a> and what he hopes to see there in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Woo has enjoyed a huge first-mover advantage and an established market share.

Today, he publicly announced that it was <a href=\"https://builder.gutenberghub.com/\">live on Gutenberg Hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The app is still at a concept stage, but the current online version works well. Essentially, it is an interface that allows users to piece together patterns to build entire pages. Unlike the block editor itself, users cannot directly edit the content. Instead, they can mix and match patterns, copy the block code, and paste it into the editor on their WordPress install.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When first visiting the Builder sub-site on Gutenberg Hub, users will see an empty canvas with a list of core pattern categories in the left sidebar panel. Inserting a new pattern into the page is as simple as selecting a category, searching for a preferred design, and clicking on it:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Inserting a pattern into the Builder app.\n\n\n\n<p>Users do not need to stop after inserting a single pattern. The idea behind this project is to build an entire webpage from multiple patterns. Then, grab the resulting block code via the &#8220;Copy Code&#8221; button and paste it into the editor in WordPress. It is a convenient way to play around and try out new ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, the patterns are presented for a desktop view. However, users can check how the design responds to tablet and mobile devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Builder pulls all of its current patterns directly from the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/\">WordPress Pattern Directory</a>. The <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress.org_API#Block_Patterns\">API is public</a> and allows others to build applications on top of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Kamal made no indication that he would showcase patterns from outside the official directory, it is probably not out of the question. The Builder UI has a section labeled &#8220;Core&#8221; in the sidebar. I am merely speculating, but I assume he plans to extend this in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A menu button sits in the top right corner of the Builder interface. This opens the Navigator interface. It allows visitors to customize the page layout:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Navigator panel on the right.\n\n\n\n<p>There are options for moving entire patterns up or down, trashing them, or duplicating them. Based on my experience thus far, this was an easier way to make adjustments than when attempting to select large groups of blocks in the WordPress editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only feature I would request is a &#8220;back&#8221; button. It is easy enough to open the navigator and trash an inserted pattern, but it would be quicker to undo that action via a dedicated button in the toolbar area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg Hub&#8217;s Builder does not allow visitors to customize the content of the patterns. Its purpose leans more toward layout creation. The customization happens when users paste it all back into their own WordPress editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps my favorite feature of the app is that users can share their creations with others. The Builder creates a custom URL for each variation and makes it easy to share over social media:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Popover after clicking share button.\n\n\n\n<p>The concept of sharing is almost built into WordPress&#8217;s block system. Because everything is built upon a well-rounded set of standards, the tools that others build on top of it make it easy to continue paying it forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this project is still in the concept stage, I am eager to see where Kamal takes it in the future. He also shared a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/tFaq6lqSURo\">short YouTube clip</a> of the Builder in action.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 01:13:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"Post Status: WordPress Podcast and Video Picks for the Week of April 25\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=96622\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-podcast-and-video-picks-for-the-week-of-april-25/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2806:\"<div class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\"><strong>Chima Mmeje</strong> on valuing yourself and raising your rates.

Bear in mind, IP addresses are personal identification data and therefore <a href=\"https://www.jentis.com/blog/gdpr-compliant-ip-address-anonymization/\">regulated by the GDPR</a>: &#8220;That means that some form of justification like user consent would always be needed as soon as the IP address is processed.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, let\'s take a look at the function code, its usage, and a case study.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-96677\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-function-code\">Function code</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The function <code>get_ip_address</code> can be found under <code>\\woocommerce\\includes\\class-wc-geolocation.php</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/**\n * Get current user IP Address.\n *\n * @return string\n */\npublic static function get_ip_address() {\n	if ( isset( $_SERVER&#91;\'HTTP_X_REAL_IP\'] ) ) {\n		return sanitize_text_field( wp_unslash( $_SERVER&#91;\'HTTP_X_REAL_IP\'] ) );\n	} elseif ( isset( $_SERVER&#91;\'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR\'] ) ) {\n		// Proxy servers can send through this header like this: X-Forwarded-For: client1, proxy1, proxy2\n		// Make sure we always only send through the first IP in the list which should always be the client IP.\n		return (string) rest_is_ip_address( trim( current( preg_split( \'/,/\', sanitize_text_field( wp_unslash( $_SERVER&#91;\'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR\'] ) ) ) ) ) );\n	} elseif ( isset( $_SERVER&#91;\'REMOTE_ADDR\'] ) ) {\n		return sanitize_text_field( wp_unslash( $_SERVER&#91;\'REMOTE_ADDR\'] ) );\n	}\n	return \'\';\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, notice it\'s a function inside a class, <em><code>WC_Geolocation</code></em>, so it can\'t be called in the usual way by simply typing its name — we also need to reference the class.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than that, the function checks for several <code>$_SERVER</code> key/values, and based on whether they are set or not it returns the IP address as a string e.g. &#8220;<em>123.456.789.0</em>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a developer, I have no intention of understanding the difference between <code>$_SERVER[\'HTTP_X_REAL_IP\']</code>, <code>$_SERVER[\'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR\']</code>, and <code>$_SERVER[\'REMOTE_ADDR\']</code>. All I care about is the final result, so that I can speed up my custom coding operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Function usage</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, the function can be called with the following statement:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>WC_Geolocation::get_ip_address(); // CORRECT</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it\'s a function inside a class, the class must be specified. Calling this in your custom snippet or plugin would throw an error:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>get_ip_address(); // WRONG</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we know how to call it, let\'s see what WooCommerce does with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <code>\\woocommerce\\includes\\class-wc-checkout.php</code> we find the following statement:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>public function create_order( $data ) {\n   /* .... */\n   $order-&gt;set_customer_ip_address( WC_Geolocation::get_ip_address() );</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s right — upon order creation during checkout, the customer IP address is saved to the order as custom metadata.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another call can be found under <code>\\woocommerce\\includes\\wc-core-functions.php</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>function wc_create_order( $args = array() ) {\n   /* ... */\n   $order-&gt;set_customer_ip_address( WC_Geolocation::get_ip_address() );</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This time, it\'s for orders created programmatically — i.e., not through the checkout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s now evident that the only reason that function is there is to display this:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"752\" height=\"408\" src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-4-752x408.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-96679\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So, let\'s see if we can use the function for other purposes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Function case study</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As we said earlier, and if you\'re allowed under your country\'s regulations, you may use the IP address for different scenarios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first that comes to mind is coding some custom tracking for a customer who isn\'t logged in to a user account. You could use that tracking method to troubleshoot cart abandonment or understand your customer\'s path out of the sales cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could call the function on the &#8220;add to cart&#8221; hook:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>do_action( \'woocommerce_add_to_cart\', $cart_item_key, $product_id, $quantity, $variation_id, $variation, $cart_item_data );</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you could call it in the cart page &#8220;proceed to checkout&#8221; hook, which is equivalent to calling any checkout hook:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>do_action( \'woocommerce_before_checkout_form\' );</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you could call it on the thank you page hook:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>do_action( \'woocommerce_thankyou\' );</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In this way, you can follow a visitor who is not logged in along their path to or away from a conversion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a previous episode, we spoke about the <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/woocommerce-function-of-the-week-wc_get_logger/\">wc_get_logger</a> function. It\'s useful for creating custom logs in the WooCommerce admin, so let\'s make the most of it and create a custom log for each unique IP address that hits our website and visits key WooCommerce pages:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/**\n* @snippet       IP customer conversion log | WooCommerce\n* @how-to        Get CustomizeWoo.com FREE\n* @author        Rodolfo Melogli\n* @testedwith    WooCommerce 6\n* @donate $9     https://businessbloomer.com/bloomer-armada/\n*/\n\n// USER ADDS TO CART\n\nadd_action( \'woocommerce_add_to_cart\', \'bbloomer_log_ip_added_to_cart\', 9999, 6 );\n\nfunction bbloomer_log_ip_added_to_cart( $cart_item_key, $product_id, $quantity, $variation_id, $variation, $cart_item_data ) {\n   $logger = wc_get_logger();\n   $logger-&gt;info( WC_Geolocation::get_ip_address() . \' added to cart product ID: \' . $product_id, array( \'source\' =&gt; \'ip-path\' ) );\n}\n\n// USER GOES TO CHECKOUT\n\nadd_action( \'woocommerce_before_checkout_form\', \'bbloomer_log_ip_went_to_checkout\' );\n\nfunction bbloomer_log_ip_went_to_checkout() {\n   $logger = wc_get_logger();\n   $logger-&gt;info( WC_Geolocation::get_ip_address() . \' went to checkout\', array( \'source\' =&gt; \'ip-path\' ) );\n}\n\n// USER MAKES PURCHASE\n\nadd_action( \'woocommerce_thankyou\', \'bbloomer_log_ip_purchased\' );\n\nfunction bbloomer_log_ip_purchased() {\n   $logger = wc_get_logger();\n   $logger-&gt;info( WC_Geolocation::get_ip_address() . \' purchased!\', array( \'source\' =&gt; \'ip-path\' ) );\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This time I\'ll leave the testing part to you.

They celebrated by launching one of the most frequently requested features, a <a href=\"https://spinupwp.com/whats-new/manage-servers-and-sites-from-the-command-line/\">command-line interface</a> to manage servers and sites from the terminal.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Other recent updates include <a href=\"https://spinupwp.com/whats-new/external-databases/\">external database support</a>, the <a href=\"https://spinupwp.com/whats-new/site-log-viewer-launched/\">site log viewer</a> which allows you to view the last 1,000 lines from the WordPress debug.log file, as well as the Nginx access.log and error.log files, support for <a href=\"https://spinupwp.com/whats-new/support-for-digitalocean-oauth/\">DigitalOcean OAuth</a> which makes provisioning new DigitalOcean servers a breeze, and the new <a href=\"https://spinupwp.com/whats-new/path-redirects/\">Path Redirects</a> feature for managing multiple redirects at the server level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the CLI, SpinupWP has also released a <a href=\"https://github.com/deliciousbrains/spinupwp-php-sdk\">PHP SDK</a> which is powered by the <a href=\"https://api.spinupwp.com/#spinupwp-rest-api\">SpinupWP REST API</a>, offering you multiple options to manage your sites and servers.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>I asked Brad Touesnard, founder and CEO of Delicious Brains, where the idea for SpinupWP came from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Back in 2002, I started a hosting company with my college roommate and built a hosting control panel from scratch,&#8221; Touesnard said. &#8220;I made many bad design decisions building that software and have always wanted another crack at it. For example, that control panel had to be installed on every server, and I dreamed of a centralized control panel that simply connected to each server via SSH and ran commands. There’s something beautiful about that design that I’ve wanted to realize for many years.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That idea stayed with Touesnard as he founded Delicious Brains and grew the company and its product offering. The advent and popularity of Virtual Private Server (VPS) providers like DigitalOcean, Amazon AWS, and Google Cloud led to other open-source projects building managed server platforms for them. Laravel Forge was one such platform, which Touesnard and the team found very interesting. Many team members have launched WordPress-related projects and sites, and a few of them used Laravel Forge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The server software requirements for Laravel and WordPress are similar, but it would always require some extra configuration to host WordPress sites. This inspired SpinupWP lead developer Ashley Rich to write the first iteration of a tutorial on how to host WordPress yourself, which eventually became the <a href=\"https://spinupwp.com/blog/#install-wordpress-ubuntu\">Install WordPress on Ubuntu</a> guide. After that, Rich and other team members like Iain Poulson switched from Forge or whatever service they were using to following the guide and self-hosting WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>“Our team became very fond of using Ashley’s guide to configure servers for WordPress sites and Laravel apps, but setting it all up was complicated and time-consuming,&#8221; Touesnard said. &#8220;So Ashley built a small app to automate the provision steps. We discussed the possible value of this app at a company retreat in 2017. We started talking about whether this would make sense as a new Delicious Brains product, an app similar to Laravel Forge but designed specifically for WordPress. We realized there were many really cool things we could do by focusing on WordPress and got really excited about building it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SpinupWP is the culmination of all these ideas. It’s a managed cloud server control panel that connects to your VPS provider and gives you everything you need to create servers and sites at the click of a button. You retain complete control of your infrastructure, but SpinupWP helps you manage everything in one place.

Not quite as heavy on the feature list as its predecessor, the update focuses more on improvements and bug fixes. The highlight of the release is the overhauled border design component.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One notable bug that theme authors should watch out for is <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/40469\">missing styles in the site editor</a>. When enqueueing stylesheets via <code>wp_enqueue_block_style()</code>, they are noticeably absent. This bug was introduced in Gutenberg 13.0 but has yet to be fixed. It is not an issue in the WordPress 6.0 beta releases and is only present in the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release also included a couple of block-related changes that I do not dive into later. The Categories block now has a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39426\">setting for hiding &#8220;empty&#8221; categories</a> (those without posts). And the duotone button has a new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40435\">triangle-shaped icon</a> by default, which reverts to its circular shape when a filter has been applied.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Border Controls</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Adjusting all four borders of a Group block.\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-13-0-adds-text-selection-across-multiple-blocks-new-stack-group-variation-and-featured-cover-blocks\">Gutenberg 13.0</a> introduced new <code>BorderControl</code> and <code>BoxBorderControl</code> components. These updates were an overhaul of the previous border design tools that users would see in the block inspector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With 13.1, any block that opts into border support will <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/37770\">use the new components</a>. This allows end-users to define the top, right, bottom, and left borders. Theme authors can also register these individual borders via <code>theme.json</code> for specific blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside this update, the core Column block <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39967\">now has border support</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block &#8220;Settings&#8221; Panel Renamed</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Block settings panel as shown with the Archives block.\n\n\n\n<p>One of my favorite changes will likely not get much attention, but it is worth mentioning. Over a dozen blocks had custom settings panels that read &#8220;Block Name settings&#8221; in the block inspector. These have all been <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40275\">reduced to &#8220;Settings.&#8221;</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The update might seem minor, but the UI is more polished without the cruft. It is not the most exciting work contributors are putting into the project, but it is the necessary stuff that creates a better user experience in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugin authors who have followed the Gutenberg naming scheme for their own blocks&#8217; settings panels should take note. It might be time to do the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Media &amp; Text Font Size Change</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Font size in Media &amp; Text now set to the default.\n\n\n\n<p>The latest plugin release <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40329\">changes the template</a> used to create the Media &amp; Text block. In the past, a large font size was given to the default Paragraph block inserted into the &#8220;text&#8221; column. The update removes this issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has long been one of those frustrating defaults set by the editor that users would need to adjust each time they added the block. It was also a problem for theme developers who either removed or did not support that specific font size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Now, if we could only do the same for the Cover block…</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Improved Comments Query Loop and Related Blocks</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />New Comments Title block.\n\n\n\n<p>Two weeks ago, I reviewed the new <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-comment-related-blocks-arriving-with-wordpress-6-0\">comment-related blocks shipping with WordPress 6.0</a>. While the concepts had potential, the experience was still buggier than I expected late into the release cycle. However, those issues are now fixed via a massive team effort. Most, if not all, should also be in <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/04/wordpress-6-0-beta-3/\">WordPress 6.0 Beta 3</a>, which landed yesterday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The introduction of the Comments Query Loop block opened a ton of flexibility for theme authors and users alike. It acts as a wrapper for other comment-related blocks that can be rearranged for different designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary issues were on the front-end output. <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40455\">Comment classes</a> were not output via the Comment Template block, but that feature was not a deal-breaker. However, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40268\">the missing ID</a> meant that comment permalinks and the comment-reply script were not working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the other missing pieces was the &#8220;X responses to Post Title&#8221; heading. This was needed to bring feature parity with the Post Comments block, deprecated in Gutenberg 13.0. I shared a starting point that others, particularly Carlos Bravo, built upon, creating an even better version. Now, we have a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40419\">dedicated Comments Title block</a> in Gutenberg. I was happy to play even a small role in making it happen.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 04:01:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:133:\"WPTavern: Coming in Gutenberg 13.2: Users’ Editor Preferences Will Be Stored in the Database, Improving Persistence Across Sessions\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=133717\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:139:\"https://wptavern.com/coming-in-gutenberg-13-1-users-editor-preferences-will-be-stored-in-the-database-improving-persistence-across-sessions\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3122:\"<img />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Welcome to the Block Editor!&#8221; Once you have dismissed this notice, why does it keep coming back? For years users have complained about this and the fact that their settings in the editor do not seem to save across sessions. They have taken to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/disable-welcome-to-the-block-editor/\">official support forums</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/le16fb/remove_welcome_to_the_block_editor/\">Reddit</a> to find out how to <a href=\"https://machouinard.com/disable-that-damn-welcome-to-the-block-editor-message/\">block this message</a> from appearing. WordPress developer Johan Jonk Stenström even created a plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/welcome-to-the-block-editor-b-gone/\">Welcome to the block editor B gone</a>, which removes the welcome message altogether. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, WordPress has stored users&#8217; editor preferences in the browser. In 2019, web developer Andrew Duthie described the problem in a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/15105\">ticket</a> on GitHub:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>In the block editor, this is used in a few stores to persist preferences (e.g. toolbar placement, &#8220;new user experience&#8221; tips, etc).</p><p>Due to the transient nature of browser storage, this persistence is not as&nbsp;<em>sticky</em>&nbsp;as it is expected to be, including: switching browsers (unique storage between browsers), or using private browsing tabs (storage cleared between sessions), or the same user across a network of sites (storage unique by domain).</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Duthie suggested that Gutenberg persist users&#8217; editor preferences to the database rather than local storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 13.2 is set to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39795\">introduce a new preferences persistence API</a> and a new package that saves these preferences to the WordPress database, as part of the user&#8217;s meta. It also includes local (legacy) storage as a backup. This will solve many longstanding problems users have had with preferences not persisting across sessions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One interesting sidenote is that Gutenberg engineer Riad Benguella <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39795#issuecomment-1110862141\">found</a> that this PR <a href=\"https://codehealth.vercel.app/\">improved the &#8220;block selection&#8221; (focus) performance by nearly 50%</a>.

My name is Nathan Wrigley. Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress, the people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, the building of useful blocks and making them freely available. If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast, player of choice. Or by going to WP tavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy and paste that URL into most podcast players as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast. Well, I&#8217;m very keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea featured on the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Head over to WP tavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox. And you can use the contact form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Aki Hamano. Aki is a freelance developer from Japan. He builds websites for clients and enjoys setting himself difficult problems to solve. He came to my attention when Justin Tatlock wrote an article on the Tavern. About a playful block he&#8217;d created, but more on that later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a little further exploration, it turns out that Aki&#8217;s been busy in his spare time, creating a range of blocks. All of them useful and all of them freely available in the WordPress plugin repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We start off by having a brief chat about what the WordPress scene is like in Japan. Is there a strong sense of community and do in-person events take place there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then move on to talk about how he became interested in creating blocks. Did he find it easy to understand the new skills required to get up and running? And was there enough documentation to make speedy progress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We spend the remainder of the podcast talking through the five blocks, which Aki has put in the WordPress plugin repository. Often they were created to scratch his own itch, to solve a problem that he faced in his work. But sometimes, as with his excellent piano block, it was just for fun, and the challenge of trying something new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The piano block aside. All of our keys blocks have an easy to understand purpose and they take on a simple challenge and solve it. This is perhaps one of the main reasons that blocks are so interesting. They can be simple or complex, utilitarian or just fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an interesting discussion. And you never know, perhaps you&#8217;ll find yourself using Aki&#8217;s blocks at some point yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading over to WP tavern.com forward slash podcast. Where you&#8217;ll find all of the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you, Aki Hamano.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Aki Hamano. Hello Aki.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:35] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> Hello, Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I am really pleased to have you on the podcast today. Real welcome to you. Aki is joining us today to talk largely about blocks. We&#8217;ve had a few conversations before this, trying to figure out what it is that we&#8217;re going to say. We&#8217;re going to talk mainly about Aki&#8217;s contribution to wordpress.org and the blocks that he&#8217;s created there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all Aki would you just introduce yourself, tell us who you are and where you come from?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:06] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> Okay. I&#8217;m a web developer by living in Japan. And I built many website, for my client and recently, in my side project, I create some blocks, and published to wordpress.org plugin directory. It&#8217;s very fantastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We will be talking about those blocks later. There&#8217;s many of them and some of them have a very serious purpose, as we&#8217;ll find out, and some of them are just for fun. So we&#8217;ll get into that in a moment. Before then, could you just tell us a little bit about the WordPress community in Japan? I confess I have never been to Japan, and I don&#8217;t know too many people in the WordPress community in Japan. So I&#8217;m just interested to hear what it&#8217;s like, how big it is. Are there any meetups? Anything like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:02] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> Ah, yes. Actually, we plan to create an event, WordPress Mega Meetup in May. And there is a lot of communities in Japan, and we are enjoying to contribute or talking about WordPress or create things. It&#8217;s very exciting in Japan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you have regular meetups spread throughout Japan? For example, in the UK, there are different meetups, usually in the big cities like Leeds and London and Manchester and so on. Do you have meetups in Japan as well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:43] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> Actually, I don&#8217;t have a meetup, but the biggest meetup is WordPress Tokyo meetup. That&#8217;s the biggest communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And are real world events happening at the moment, or like the rest of the world, are you doing virtual meetups because of COVID restrictions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:04] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s all virtual, like it is here in the UK. Well, it&#8217;s nice to, nice to have you on the show. If anybody who is listening to this, is from Japan, we&#8217;d be most interested to hear from you and possibly get engaged in conversations about what people in Japan are doing with WordPress. But it&#8217;s nice to hear that you&#8217;ve got your Mega Meetup, hopefully coming out in May.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about your blocks. Well, before we get to your blocks, let&#8217;s talk about blocks in general. And I want to ask you the question, what is it that you like about blocks? Why do you find blocks to be exciting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:41] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> I have a simple answer. I love to build the things, and I think it was similar to use Lego blocks. It&#8217;s very exciting, and I&#8217;m very excited to see on block editor when I create some little code on my editor. It&#8217;s a very, very fantastic, that&#8217;s all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Did you start to build blocks right at the beginning? Have you been doing it for years or is it more recent? Have you just been doing it for a year or two years or three years?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:17] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> Maybe three, maybe three years, and actually my first block plugin, Rich Text Extension. And WP Tavern posted an article about this plugin three years ago. That&#8217;s my first block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There&#8217;s quite a few more that have come down the pipe and we&#8217;ll get to those in just a moment. We&#8217;ll do them one at a time in a minute. I&#8217;m curious to know how difficult you found it. Was it very hard to learn the new skills required to build blocks? Did you find it straightforward or was it really challenged?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:57] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> Ah yes. I think it&#8217;s very, very hard. because we need to build codes and we need to learn another language, JavaScript, and framework reworked or NPM. I didn&#8217;t know why do we need to build the code because, for example, PHP works you know? I didn&#8217;t understand what does it mean to build. So, it was very difficult to understand the commands, new language and the build tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Why did you make the effort? If it was really difficult, why did you persevere and why did you keep going with all of this difficult new technology, when it would have been easier just to carry on doing what you were always doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:49] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> So. I will learn from and Block Editor Handbook. There is many tutorials on there. It&#8217;s very useful document. I started to create blocks. And another example, there is a useful GitHub repository, Gutenberg Examples. There are many examples on the repository and I analyze these codes, and also, I deep dive into Gutenberg core code and core blocks. It&#8217;s hard to understand these codes, but it&#8217;s very useful for me to build the blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you think it&#8217;s easier now? If somebody was starting to build blocks today, do you think they would have an easier time? Are there more, tutorials, more documentation to make it easier than it was for you? Is it an easier thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:52] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> I want to recommend NPM package. So it&#8217;s a WordPress create block. The package creates a block plugin template and automatically install recommended script package. And with simple command, we can build plugin quickly. And if you change some codes in JavaScript, we can see the change on block editor. So first I want to recommend create block package.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I will link to that in the show notes. So that&#8217;s the WordPress create block package.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:35] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Are there any other tools that you have found useful? That could be things on your computer, software, or it could be resources, tutorials, or books or anything that you might have used. Is there anything which you think was really useful apart from the WordPress create block?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:55] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> There&#8217;s many tools but I use basic tools. For example, I use VS code. For local environments, I use WPM, that&#8217;s all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Just those two things?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:08] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Now I played with your blocks over the last few days and there are five, I think, currently there. You can find Aki&#8217;s Github repository which has links to the public facing versions of them. Alternatively, you can also find them on wordpress.org, and I will, in the show notes, link to them individually. There are five and I&#8217;m going to go through them in order of my favorite. Not necessarily in order of how clever they are, or how brilliant they are, but just the ones that I like, because I could see a use for them. I&#8217;ve left probably the most, interesting one until the end, which is just fantastic fun, but I couldn&#8217;t see myself using it, so I&#8217;ve left it until the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, first off, let&#8217;s talk about your flexible space of block. Now this, you will find on the wordpress.org repo as you will do for all of them. Tell us what this does. This is sublimely clever. It&#8217;s very, very cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:12] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> Yes. we know that core spacer block can create space, but only unit, and only one height. But I want to create multiple spacers, depends on window width. This plugin enables you to create three types spacer, for desktop and tablet and the mobile. And we can change the break points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So breakpoints, it&#8217;s used to media queries and also I can create a negative space. So we can cross two blocks, and I need it, so I made it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is that why? It was something you needed, and so you created it and then let it go into the repository? That&#8217;s very nice to hear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:02] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> Okay, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The interface, the way that the block works, is you obviously install it as a plugin in WordPress, and then you have an option, there&#8217;s a spacer option, which appears, a flexible spacer. And instead of the core block, which just has the spacer, Aki&#8217;s block gives you three different spacers in one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the interface shows you what the mobile spacer will do, what the tablet spacer will do, and what the desktop spacer will do. And they&#8217;re all there in the interface all at the same time. I can only say that you&#8217;ll get it if you install it. It&#8217;s difficult to explain, but the moment you actually have it on your website and you see the purpose of it, it&#8217;s brilliant. So rather than having the settings in the menu on the right, all of the settings are, well, certainly for the height, all of the height settings are actually right before you in a visual way, and then as Aki said, there&#8217;s the option to, create negative space. There&#8217;s a toggle switch and you can create negative space and then you can draw up your content to overlap with other blocks. It&#8217;s really nice. It works really, really well. Well done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:11] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The next one that I want to talk about is probably I think the most installed of the five that we&#8217;re going to talk about. This is your flexible table block. And again, I will link in the show notes. Would you just quickly tell us what your flexible table block does?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:29] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> Ah, yes. The most great point is that we can create merged cells. Core table block doesn&#8217;t allow too merge cells. This burning can create many, many kinds of styles on each cells and it&#8217;s very easy to insert or delete row and column from bottom, top of the table. So I think you can create any kinds of a table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. So when you&#8217;re in Gutenberg, after you&#8217;ve installed the plugin, you get the option to add in a block, and in this case, you want to be picking the flexible table block. If you just search for table, you&#8217;ll get the option to insert it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s got an icon with like a lightning bolt, and then it throws in a table, but the options there&#8217;s so many fantastic options. The most useful, I think of which as you said, is the ability to merge cells. So for example, if you put a three by three, three row and three column table in, you could merge all of the columns or the rows, or just a portion of them, and you can do that by clicking shift and selecting multiple cells at the same time. And then you click the little merge icon to make that happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it also brings along a whole load of other possibilities. So there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s the option to obviously add in as many rows as you want in a intuitive UI, but there&#8217;s options to add in colors, uh, you can add in headers and footers to the table, you can add in widths of difference sizes and, you know, padding and margins and all of that. And then you&#8217;ve got options for captions as well, and topography options as well. It&#8217;s got a lot, basically. And it&#8217;s all done in a visual way and it just works. Now this must I&#8217;m imagining have taken quite a long time to create.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:23] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> Yes, it might be confused to create table, but we can create any kind of table. It&#8217;s my purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> it&#8217;s really, really excellent. So again, if you go to the show notes, you&#8217;ll be able to find the flexible table block. And as Aki said, the main purpose there is just to, is to really, to be able to create any layout and merge different things. And you&#8217;ll see in the show notes on the wordpress.org repo, all of the different options and what have you. And it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s very comprehensive. Essentially, if you want a table to be displayed in almost any configuration, then the flexible table block is highly recommended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My third pick is your rich text extension.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:05] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Again really interesting. Tell us what this does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:10] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> The plugin is my first plugin. I made it two or three years ago. Now Gutenberg enables you to create inline highlight, but, two or three years ago, we don&#8217;t have the function. So, I want to create, I want to highlight inline text, or I want to enable, I want to change the inline font size. So I made it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There&#8217;s a couple of options which become available. Essentially, you can highlight text in several different ways. So you could fully highlight in one color or another. So you could, for example, in the pre-installed version, when the plugin is installed, you get the option for yellow and red, but you can change those as you wish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you can either do full highlighting of the text, or you can do half highlighting and you can, you can specify how thick the highlighting is. So for example, if you wanted it to appear almost like an underline, it could highlight a bit like that. Or alternatively, you could just go full height and highlight the whole text, and you&#8217;ve got several options to switch different things on, rename the highlighting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you might like to rename it as bold red or something like that. And then you&#8217;ve also, got the, other option, which is to change the defaults for the size of your text. So you can have as many as four different options, and you can rename them, whatever you like. And you could have like an ultra small, a medium, a big, or a really big. Pick whatever names you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then those are added into the Gutenberg editor, as options for changing the text size. So let&#8217;s say for example, that in the middle of a sentence, for some particular reason, you just wanted one word to be extremely big, you could do that with Aki&#8217;s rich text extension solution. And then of course you could highlight it as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a settings menu, which enables you to fiddle with these things, but there is only one menu and everything that you need to interact with is in that one, simple menu. Does Gutenberg now do all that this one did?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:24] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> So highlighting inline text is able to create now via Gutenberg now. But to change in line text size, we can&#8217;t create now on Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it still, it still serves a purpose, it&#8217;s still useful. Just as an aside, how often do you go back and look at these plugins and update them. I can see, for example, that the flexible spacer block was updated two months ago and you&#8217;ve updated the flexible table block just one week ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you committed to keeping each of these going? Do you go back and look at them, all five of them regularly?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:05] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> Ah yes. So before WordPress major update, I check these plugins will work. Fix some issues, I want to add some new functions, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you go back periodically and check them just to make sure each time WordPress Core is updated. That&#8217;s great. Thank you. Okay, next one, second to last one, is the custom HTML block extension. What does this do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:37] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> There is block that we can create pure HTML, and we can create pure HTML to show on front-end. It&#8217;s a custom HTML block, but it&#8217;s very hard coding on block, because there is no text highlight and it&#8217;s difficult to add indent. So I want to create some codes in editor which are like VS Code. Actually, this plugin use VS Code Core library named Monaco editor. So we can write code like we coding on VS Code. It&#8217;s very similar to VS Code. It&#8217;s easy to create code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> This feels like it was the most difficult to create. I could be wrong, but this one has so many different options in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:37] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If you wish to create something on your website, which requires you to write some HTML, but the core HTML block doesn&#8217;t really highlight things or indent things in a way which makes it easy for you to understand, because you&#8217;re used to your IDE, VS code as you&#8217;ve described in this case or whatever you&#8217;re using.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This makes the HTML in Gutenberg look and feel just like it would do in your text, editor of choice. So things can be indented, things are highlighted, the font can be altered. You can customize it to look exactly how you prefer it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then when you click save and publish, everything is output on the front end just as HTML. So, all of that design is stripped away and it becomes HTML. You know, if you&#8217;ve got something in an H1 tag, it looks like an H1 on your website, depending on what your theme is telling that to do. Again, why did you build this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:46] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> Why? So sometime I can&#8217;t create a layout with core block or other plugin. So sometime I need to write some code directly. And so I want to write code more easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If you are familiar with using a text editor, then this will just be fantastic for you. You&#8217;ve got everything that you want. You can resize, you can use things like Emmet and what have you, and, you might be able to throw in a, the demonstration that you have here is a list item, sorry, a an ordered list and you add five items in using the Emmet shortcodes and five list items will appear and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s really for those people who want to put HTML into their WordPress posts or pages and want it to look like their IDE, something that they&#8217;re familiar with, something that they&#8217;re used to. And yeah, bravo, it&#8217;s a chore doing anything in the core block cause it doesn&#8217;t have enough similarity to what you&#8217;re used to doing on your Mac or PC. Okay. So we&#8217;ll recommend that one as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And last but by no means least. This is just genius. In fact, this is the one that alerted Justin Tatlock, I think to you, he maybe been following you before this, but this was the one that he wrote a piece about over on the WP Tavern, and I&#8217;ll link to that. This is, this is the piano block. I can tell you it does exactly what you think it&#8217;s going to do. It puts, it puts a piano inside of Gutenberg. Now, why, why do we need a piano inside Gutenberg? This is brilliant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:33] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> First, I want to say it&#8217;s just fun. And maybe someone might say, what can they do with this plugin or, what does it mean. My purpose, my purpose to build these things is, enjoy to create. I want to try a potential, possibility of block editor..</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to know what block editor can create, can explain, and also, I love music. I wanted to play music on book editor. It was crazy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s something that I just find really interesting. The idea that it doesn&#8217;t have a purpose beyond learning how to use the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would thoroughly encourage everybody to go and install this one one, and just put it somewhere and try it out. Basically what you get is a block and you add the piano block. It&#8217;s got a lovely, obvious icon. It&#8217;s probably the most obvious icon I&#8217;ve ever seen that clearly is a piano as an icon. And, you get, it looks like a couple of octaves, keys are all there. You&#8217;ve got keyboard shortcuts, so every key on the piano is mapped to a key on your keyboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you really wanted to, you could actually play on the keyboard. Alternatively, you can just hover over with your mouse and click on the key in question. You can increase the volume and decrease the volume. There&#8217;s the opportunity to choose from, I don&#8217;t know, it looks like about 12 different sounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;ve got an acoustic bass and electric guitar and organ, a regular piano, violin, harp, and xylophone and so on. And then there&#8217;s the addition of, there&#8217;s a toggle switch for those people who like to have sustain. So it turns the sustain pedal on and off. Now the only purpose is for fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:29] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> At the minute, it doesn&#8217;t go onto the front end though does it? If you publish this, that block will not appear on your website. It&#8217;s only in the editor itself. Now, why is that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:43] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> My purpose is to play on block editor, not the front end. It&#8217;s the reason, and it was difficult to create piano on front end because this block made with React, and I don&#8217;t build React on front end now, but I think it is possible. In the future I may enable it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So at the minute, it&#8217;s not able on the front end because there&#8217;s gaps in the knowledge that you have. It&#8217;s built with React on the backend, and you&#8217;ve yet to figure out how to make that happen. Obviously with a project, as fun as this, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily have a purpose on the front-end and probably it&#8217;s not right at the top of your priority list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got to say though, it&#8217;s got the least options, a lot of the other ones, for example the rich text extension that you have and the flexible table block, they&#8217;ve got lots of different options available to style the way things look and so on. The custom HTML block extension in particular has lots and lots of different options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m imagining though that they were potentially easier to build than the piano block, because the piano block, It&#8217;s like a toy, it&#8217;s almost like a game built inside of the editor. So was the piano block, was that the most difficult to pull off because, you know, you&#8217;ve got all sorts of things happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re creating sounds at the moment that you click a button and those sounds have to be a particular octave. They have to add sustain and be generated by a different audio sound. I&#8217;m imagining, you know, depending on which instrument you&#8217;re manipulating. Was that the most challenging one to build?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:25] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> Uh, yeah. This plugin used web audio API, and web audio API is very, very complicated, but I use wrapper library, tone.js. It&#8217;s enabled to create sounds with small code. And most of the difficult things is to find good sounds, because this plugin used real audio sounds, each note.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh wow, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:55] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> I needed to find audio with GPL compatibility. It&#8217;s very difficult to find it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, for example, if I play, I don&#8217;t know, an a on the acoustic piano and then play a D for example, then they are different audio files that you&#8217;re pulling out in order to render that sound?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:17] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s really interesting. These are all free. Obviously the piano block is just something a bit different. It&#8217;s a bit of fun, but all of the other four that we mentioned, they&#8217;re all free and they all have a very useful application. Do you plan now that you&#8217;ve got all this experience, do you plan at any point to come out with any new blocks, any new things that we might hear about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:43] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> Now, I have no idea, but I want to create block for full site editor. For example, I want to create block, inside the query loop block. For example, if the article was posted in a few days, we need a new level. So I&#8217;m planning to create a new level block. Or social network sharing link block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you&#8217;ve got a couple planned for the future. This must take a lot of time. And although you described earlier that you&#8217;ve been doing this so that you can learn, and in some cases you needed something to be done, presumably for your websites. Do you plan on creating revenue, charging, having a pro version of any of these, or are they always going to be freely available on the repo?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:41] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> So, I want to create these plugins for free. It depends on WordPress philosophy. No, I don&#8217;t think because I get money from my own work. So these plugins don&#8217;t need money. I want create these plugins for free in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s absolutely fantastic to hear. I love the fact that you&#8217;ve created so many free plugins and they&#8217;re so different from each other. If anybody wanted to reach out to you and talk about these different blocks that you&#8217;ve created, what&#8217;s the best way? That could be an email or it may be a Twitter account or perhaps Slack. What&#8217;s the best way to get in touch with you Aki?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:25] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> If you love these plugins, please follow my Twitter account, or please send and direct message. Or please check my Github repositories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I will link to all of those. The accounts for Github, the Twitter account, I will link to in the show notes. So yeah, if you want to reach out to Aki and express your gratitude, or just have any questions, then be sure to check out the show notes on the WP Tavern website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for joining us on the podcast today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:00] <strong>Aki Hamano:</strong> Me too.

Eventually, when I quit my Software Engineer position at Novell, it was for the same reason. I could not do justice to my work and my family. This might be a refrain that many women might identify with. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After quitting the job, I explored a few different fields for a couple of years. Eventually, I registered for a PhD thinking that I’d fit into the academia. However, by the time I finished it, I was not willing to work at any University. With an Engineering College a few metres away from my home, many of my friends and neighbours suggested that I should try to get a position there, but I was adamant that I shall not go for it, as the rules and restrictions of a typical college environment in South India did not resonate with me.</p>\n<h2>At the Crossroads</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to some nagging health issues and two young children &#8211; one a new-born, I was very keen on doing something on my own terms. But my options were minimal. It was at this time, that I felt like a beautifully crafted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veena\">Veena</a> which got eventually trashed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favourite Tamil poet Bharathi wrote these lines asking the Supreme power why She chose to craft a beautiful Veena only to trash it. He was referring to the potential and intelligence in him that he was wasting away. He prayed to be empowered to live a useful life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would repeat his lines and wonder why I couldn’t make something useful out of my life, out of all the knowledge I had gathered, out of all the skills I had spent hundreds of hours to hone. I wondered if I was being stubborn by not choosing the path of least resistance &#8211; working for the nearby educational institution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my mid-thirties, armed with a PhD in Natural Language Processing(NLP), and scattered experiences in various areas of software, my other options were minimal. After intense introspection and googling, I realized that I could try a remote job as a last resort. The WordPress ecosystem seemed to be full of remote positions, but I did not have the skills for it. Till then, I had in-depth understanding and command over C, Perl, the Unix OS and the command line utilities. As far as web development was concerned, I had the experience of writing hardcoded html home pages(some of you might remember this era) a decade before.</p>\n<h2>Starting Fresh</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At this juncture, I had a choice to look for some work with my then skillsets and qualifications, given my constraints, or to start from scratch on web development. I chose to do the latter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lines from Rudyard Kipling’s<em> If </em>were my mantra in those days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If you can make one heap of all your winnings</em><br /><em>And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,</em><br /><em>And lose, and start again at your beginnings</em><br /><em>And never breathe a word about your loss;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, I was feeling quite bad about my loss, the loss of NLP from my day-to-day work. But it was important for me to do something with my skills than to be very selective about what I was doing, as I was not willing to compromise on the other conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I set to work.</p>\n<p>I started a couple of WordPress sites; One of them, a book review site PlusMinus’nMore, built on WordPress, became quite popular over a few years; I started a social startup named RAPO, to bring people together through books and wrote the application for it; I freelanced &#8211; wrote tutorials on WordPress and Linux, offered part-time support and documentation service for themes and plugins. My good friend, who was running her own venture using Zoho, outsourced any HTML/CSS sub-tasks to me; I contributed to WordPress Core and also offered Tamil Translations for plugins and themes. I wrote amateurish plugins and released them. I was willing to do anything to learn WordPress, as a user and as a developer. All of this happened at the comfort of my home, without having to compromise on the care I gave for my children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, freelancing soon became quite overwhelming because of the administrative overheads. Consequently, I started applying for remote positions. It was difficult to get a break because I was overqualified. It was a miracle that I got into <a href=\"https://prospress.com/\">ProsPress Inc</a>. and suddenly, I found myself a remote developer working on WooCommerce Subscriptions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a couple of years, Automattic happened and I moved over to the Woo Data team. I still don’t do NLP in my day-today job, and my knowledge on the trends in NLP or ML is quite outdated. However, I am keeping my hopes alive and learning a lot on a range of things that I work on everyday &#8211; Payments, the Hadoop ecosystem and Functional Programming in Scala to name a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, I have relocated to Dubai thanks to my remote job. I am glad that I chose the WordPress ecosystem because it has given me what I wanted and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lessons To Take Away</h2>\n<p>What I learnt from these events and what I frequently remind myself of:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>The past is gone. The present and future are in my hands. I can always start afresh and find meaning from the rest of my life.</li>\n<li>It is important to keep choosing what I enjoy doing, without looking for rewards, even if it does not make sense always. I shall be able to connect the dots later.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>So, my dear reader, where ever you are in the world, whatever your current situation might be, especially if you’re a mom who had a high-flying career which you had to let go off, I hope my story inspires you to remember that the present and the future are in your hands, if you’re not reluctant to start afresh. Do your duty towards your family, but do not compromise on what you want out of life. Keep walking the journey and the future will present options that you never dreamt of.</p>\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"tamil\"><b>முன்னேறிடு</b> <b>முன்னேறிடு</b></h1>\n<p>என் வாழ்க்கையைத் திரும்பிப் பார்க்கும்போது, பள்ளி மற்றும் கல்லூரியில் படிக்கும்போதும் சரி, அல்லது வேலையில் இருக்கும்போதும் சரி, பல முறை என் ஆற்றலுக்கேற்றவற்றைத் தவிர்த்து, எளியவற்றைத் தேர்ந்தெடுத்துள்ளேன். உள்ளூர, என்னால் மிக உன்னதமான குறிக்கோள்களை மேற்கொண்டு செவ்வனே செய்ய முடியுமா என்ற ஐயமும், குடும்பத்தைப் புறக்கணித்து விடுவேனோ என்ற பயமும் தான் காரணம். நோவெல் நிறுவனத்தில் மென்பொருள் பொறியாளர் வேலையை ராஜினாமா செய்ததும் இக்காரணத்தால்தான். இது பல பெண்களுக்கு எங்கேயோ கேட்ட பல்லவியாக இருக்கக்கூடும்.</p>\n<p>வேலையை விட்டவுடன், சும்மா இருக்க விருப்பமில்லாமல் சில தொழில்-சார்ந்த படிப்புகளை ஆராய்ந்து, இறுதியாக முனைவர் பட்டத்துக்குப் பதிவு செய்தேன். ஆனால் அதை முடிக்கும்போது எனக்கு எந்தப் பல்கலைக்கழகத்திலும் வேலை பார்க்க விருப்பமில்லை. என் வீட்டிற்கு அருகிலேயே ஒரு தொழில்நுட்பக்கல்லூரி இருந்ததால், என் நண்பர்களும் அண்டை வீட்டாரும் அதில் விண்ணப்பிக்குமாறு பரிந்துரைத்தனார். ஆனால் எனக்கு தென்னிந்தியக் கல்லூரிகளின் விதிகளும் கட்டுப்பாடுகளும் தரும் ஒவ்வாமையால் அதைத் தவிர்த்துவிட்டேன்.</p>\n<h2>நல்லதோர் வீணை</h2>\n<p>சில நாள்பட்ட உடலூறுகள், மற்றும் இரு சிறு குழந்தைகளின் பராமரிப்பு என்ற இருவேறு காரணங்களால் நான் என் நிபந்தனைகளுக்குட்பட்ட ஏதாவது செய்யவேண்டும் என்பதில் குறியாக இருந்தேன். ஆனால் எனக்கு ஒரு வழியும் தென்படவில்லை.</p>\n<p>என் அனுக்கக் கவி பாரதி, சிவசக்தியிடம் </p>\n<p>&#8220;நல்லதோர் வீணை செய்தே, அதை நலம்கெட புழுதியில் எறிவதுண்டோ?<br />சொல்லடீ சிவசக்தி, எனைச் சுடர்மிகுமறிவுடன் படைத்துவிட்டாய்!<br />வல்லமை தாராயோ இந்த மாநிலம் பயனுற வாழ்வதற்கே!&#8221;</p>\n<p>என்று முறையிட்ட வரிகள் என்னுள் எப்பொழுதும் ரீங்காரமிட்டுக்கொண்டிருந்தன. அந்த வரிகளில் நான் என்னைக் கண்டேன். எத்தனையோ விஷயங்களைக் கற்றும், பல நூறு மணி நேரங்கள் பாடுபட்டு வளர்த்துக்கொண்ட திறன்கள் இருந்தும், அவை யாருக்கும் பயனற்றுப் போவதாகத் தோன்றியது. ஒருவேளை அது கல்லூரியில் வேலை பார்க்க மாட்டேன் என்ற என் பிடிவாதத்தால் தானோ என்று என்னை நானே கேட்டுக்கொண்டேன்.</p>\n<p>முப்பத்தைந்து வயதில், முனைவர் பட்டம் மற்றும் மென்பொருள் அனுபவம் வைத்துக்கொண்டு வேறு என்ன செய்யமுடியும் என்று யோசித்தேன். மிகுந்த ஆராய்ச்சிக்குப் பின், வீட்டிலிருந்து செய்யக்கூடிய இணையவழி வேலைகள் பற்றி அறிந்து கொண்டேன். வர்ட்ப்ரெஸ்(WordPress) தொடர்பான வேலைகள் பலவும் இப்படிப்பட்டவையாக இருந்தன. ஆனால் எனக்கு இணைய மென்பொருள் உருவாக்கத்தில்(Web development) எந்தவொரு அனுபவமும் கிடையாது. எனக்குத் தெரிந்ததெல்லாம் சி(C), பேர்ல்(Perl), யூனிக்ஸ்(Unix) மட்டுமே.</p>\n<h2>புதிய பாதை</h2>\n<p>இந்தக் கட்டத்தில், ஒன்று, நான் என் படிப்பு மற்றும் தகுதிகளுக்கேற்ற வேலை செய்யலாம் அல்லது வர்ட்ப்ரெஸ்ஸைப் புதிதாகக் கற்றுக்கொண்டு வேலை தேடலாம். நான் வர்ட்ப்ரெஸ்ஸைத் தேர்ந்தெடுத்தேன்.</p>\n<p>ஆங்கில எழுத்தாளர் ருட்யார்ட் கிப்ளிங்கின் (Rudyard Kipling) &#8216;இஃப்&#8217; (If) என்ற கவிதையின் சில வரிகள் என் நினைவுக்கு வந்தன. “ஒருவேளை, உன் வாழ்க்கையின் எல்லா வெற்றிகளையும் மூட்டைக்கட்டி சூதாடி, ஒரே சுண்டில் அவற்றையெல்லாம் இழந்துவிட்டு, மீண்டும் முதல் படியிலிருந்து தொடங்கி, உன் இழப்புகளைப் பற்றி யாரித்திடமும் புலம்பாமால் இருக்கமுடியுமானால் நீ உன் வாழ்க்கையில் வெற்றி பெறலாம்”, என்ற அந்த வரிகளே எனக்குத் தாரக மந்திரமானது.</p>\n<p>வெகுவாக புலம்பவில்லை என்றாலும், உள்ளுக்குள் வலித்தது. ஆனால் நான் விட்டுக்கொடுக்க விரும்பாத சில நிபந்தனைகள் வைத்திருந்ததால், இது ஒன்றே முன்னேறும் வழி என்று முடிவெடுத்தேன்.</p>\n<p>செயலில் இறங்கினேன்.</p>\n<p>சில வர்ட்ப்ரெஸ் தளங்களை உருவாக்கினேன்.

MemberPress is a popular membership plugin for WordPress. It is a commercial-only plugin starting at $179/year for one site, and there is no free version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reddit user @hamsternose opened the discussion with a first-hand account of having gotten locked out: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>So I just discovered that&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://docs.memberpress.com/article/375-memberpress-backend-deactivated\" target=\"_blank\">MemberPress</a>&nbsp;has changed its subscription model and will now cease to work the second your license expires and you need to reticence to get it working again.</p><p>This is the first WordPress plugin I have come across that works this way and I can&#8217;t say I am a fan. I support keeping plugins updated but I don&#8217;t believe this should be forced as it pretty much locks users in to meeting whatever price demands a developer chooses.</p><p>Is this the way forwards for WordPress Plugin developers now?</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>MemberPress&#8217; updated renewal policy is clearly outlined in the plugin&#8217;s docs about <a href=\"https://docs.memberpress.com/article/371-what-happens-when-my-subscription-ends\">what happens when a user&#8217;s subscription ends</a>. The most controversial action is that customers will no longer &#8220;have access to any of the MemberPress admin screens.&#8221; The policy states:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Essentially, you’ll be able to keep using MemberPress on the front end of your site indefinitely when your subscription ends. However, you won’t be able to access the plugin’s admin screens or functions. Unless you renew, we’ll also no longer be able to support any changes or additions to your site.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Cutting off access to the plugin&#8217;s admin screens leaves users without the ability to manage the membership functions of their sites if their subscriptions lapse. This prevents users from doing things like issuing customer refunds, adding new members, managing memberships and site activations, among other actions.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>This unorthodox approach is surprising in contrast to most other commercial plugins&#8217; renewal policies, which usually terminate support and updates for those who do not renew. Cutting off functionality in this fashion could be especially problematic for agencies managing websites for clients using MemberPress. It&#8217;s something critical to business operations and prospective customers should be aware that the policy is markedly different from most other commercial WordPress products. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I can understand a &#8216;no more updates for you&#8217; policy, but shutting down something you paid for (at least once) is not good,&#8221; web developer Mauro Bono <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UpTheIrons1978/status/1519042418938728449\">said</a> in response to Post Status <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status/status/1518994407864684545\">proposing</a> WordPress businesses create a trade association to govern practices like this and admin notification infringements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think companies should be allowed to do it, but I think the community will speak with its feet and move to a product that doesn&#8217;t do this kind of thing,&#8221; Trew Knowledge Sr. Product Owner Malcolm Peralty said. &#8220;It&#8217;s all about balance and I think this swings too far away from what I feel is &#8216;fair.\'&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The GPL permits companies to sell open source software. In this case users are also purchasing, perhaps unknowingly, the code that shuts the plugin&#8217;s admin functions off as soon as they don&#8217;t pay up to renew. Some may consider this a questionable business practice in the WordPress ecosystem but it doesn&#8217;t violate the license.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017, David Marín Carreño from the Spanish WordPress community, contacted the Free Software Foundation (FSF) regarding similarly structured business models for plugins. He asked if it is permissible for a plugin author to distribute a plugin under the GPL but lock access to some of the features using a validation code, which checks against a remote server. The <a href=\"https://davefx.com/en/2017/05/gpl-software-requiring-payments-to-work/\">FSF responded</a>: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The GPL doesn’t prohibit locks or schemes such as these, as long as the recipient of the software can modify or remove them as per the terms of the GPL. It isn’t the lock itself that is prohibited; it’s restricting others from studying, modifying, or removing that lock that the GPL prohibits. It would also be a violation of the GPL to add licensing terms which prohibit the recipient of the software from removing such feature-lock schemes.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the FSF validating the business model, many find the practice to be unsavory, as evident from the comments on the Reddit post. In a post titled <a href=\"https://therealjasoncoleman.com/2022/04/26/the-wordpress-way/\">The WordPress Way</a>, Jason Coleman, co-founder and CEO of the Paid Memberships Pro (PMP) plugin, one of MemberPress&#8217; chief competitors, seemed to indirectly address MemberPress&#8217; renewal policy, saying some companies &#8220;begrudgingly apply the GPL license to their code.&#8221; Coleman described what he perceives to be &#8220;the WordPress way:&#8221;  </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Doing things the WordPress way means making all of our software free and open source, just like the core WordPress software.</p><p>It means the plugins we write to integrate with other plugins and third parties are hosted in the WordPress.org repository because that will incentivize both parties to maintain the plugin.</p><p>It means our code will continue to work as expected if your paid license expires.</p><p>It means providing simple one-line code solutions to disable our upsells or extra gateway fees.</p><p>It means using the WordPress coding standards so our code is more readable to developers used to reading WordPress-based code.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>MemberPress founder Blair Williams has not yet responded to our requests for comment. There may be a reason or chain of experiences that led him to this renewal policy but the plugin&#8217;s documentation doesn&#8217;t elaborate on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In light of the recent discussions on Reddit and Twitter, Coleman&#8217;s promises to customers illuminates MemberPress and PMP&#8217;s contrasting values and business principles.  This may be compelling for MemberPress customers who are looking for a different plugin after learning of the updated renewal policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If a decision comes down to something that will make the software better and something that will make us more money, we choose the option that makes the software better,&#8221; Coleman said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For us that means embracing open source and the WordPress way, making our software available for free to get the most users and contributors, and building a business on top of the software we are making by adding value instead of artificially limiting our software and selling the cure.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:42:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WPTavern: Building a “Polaroid” Image Block Style\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=133739\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com/building-a-polaroid-image-block-style\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5689:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I am a child of the late &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s. Before we all had cameras built into our mobile phones&#8212;<em>well, before mobile phones took off, really</em>&#8212;families would lug around Polaroid cameras to capture those special moments. Even though I hated posing for awkward photos with my siblings, I am still nostalgic about the magic of film from a bygone era.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I have grown old enough to see the return of physical prints, sparked primarily by Fujifilm Instax. They are at least popular in the journaling groups that I lurk around. I have yet to shell out the money for one of Fujifilm&#8217;s mini cameras or smartphone printers, but I am admittedly tempted. Perhaps it is a fad, but I am still pulled toward reliving that part of my youth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of whether I own the physical equipment, I can always recreate Polaroid-style photos on the web. The WordPress block system makes it simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/category/building-with-blocks\">Building with Blocks</a> post will cater primarily to theme authors. However, DIY users can also try their hand at it. The tutorial will walk through the steps of creating a Polaroid-style image frame as a custom block style.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this tutorial, I used Twenty Twenty-Two and WordPress 6.0 Beta 2. It should also work with WordPress 5.9. For other themes, you may need to adjust the colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Building the Block Style</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Polaroid Image block style.\n\n\n\n<p>Much of the fun I have had with the block system has been creating custom styles. They typically only take a few lines of code to transform blocks into something entirely different. The Polaroid style is the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step is to use the <code><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_block_style/\">register_block_style()</a></code> function to register a custom style via your theme&#8217;s <code>functions.php</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>add_action( \'init\', \'tavern_register_block_styles\' );\n\nfunction tavern_register_block_styles() {\n    register_block_style( \'core/image\', &#91;\n        \'name\'  =&gt; \'polaroid\',\n        \'label\' =&gt; __( \'Polaroid\', \'tavern\' )\n    ] );\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Once registered, it will appear as a selectable style for the Image block in the editor. However, it still needs a custom design. For that, you only need a bit of CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add the following to your theme&#8217;s stylesheet or, preferably, <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_block_style/\">register it via <code>wp_enqueue_block_style()</code></a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>.wp-block-image&#91;class*=is-style-polaroid] {\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    padding: 1rem;\n    background-color: #fff;\n    box-shadow: 0 4px  10px 0 rgba( 0, 0, 0, 0.3 ),\n                0 0 4rem rgba( 255, 255, 235, 0.5 ) inset;\n}\n\n.wp-block-image&#91;class*=is-style-polaroid] figcaption {\n    margin-top: 1rem;\n    margin-bottom: 0;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>That is literally it. Custom block styles are such easy wins that I do not understand why more theme authors are not including them. I had 70+ in my last theme project, and I was holding back&#8212;<em>OK, so I may have gone a little overboard.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to change the &#8220;age&#8221; of the photo, you can darken the <code>inset</code> shadow in the above CSS. It is a subtle effect by default, but feel free to tinker with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keen-eyed readers may have noticed that I targeted <code>[class*=is-style-polaroid]</code> instead of <code>.is-style-polaroid</code>. There is a reason for that. It cuts back on the code for additional styles built on the same concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bonus: Tilted Styles</h2>\n\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<img />\nLeft and right titled Polaroid Image styles.\n\n\n\n<p>A Polaroid-style frame is a fun effect, but we can take that one step more and add variations for tilting images left or right. Add the following to the existing <code>tavern_register_block_styles()</code> function created in the previous section:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>register_block_style( \'core/image\', &#91;\n    \'name\'  =&gt; \'polaroid-tilt-left\',\n    \'label\' =&gt; __( \'Polaroid: Tilt Left\', \'tavern\' )\n] );\n\nregister_block_style( \'core/image\', &#91;\n    \'name\'  =&gt; \'polaroid-tilt-right\',\n    \'label\' =&gt; __( \'Polaroid: Tilt Right\', \'tavern\' )\n] );</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>For each of the &#8220;tilt&#8221; styles, you can use the <code>transform</code> CSS property along with the <code>scale()</code> and <code>rotate()</code> functions. I chose slight rotations of <code>2deg</code> and <code>-2deg</code>, but you can push that as far as you want to get your preferred design.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>.wp-block-image.is-style-polaroid-tilt-right {\n    transform: scale( 0.99, 0.99 ) rotate( 2deg );\n}\n\n.wp-block-image.is-style-polaroid-tilt-left {\n    transform: scale( 0.99, 0.99 ) rotate( -2deg );\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>One fun effect is to remove the tilt transformation when a visitor hovers their mouse over the images. Use the following CSS for that:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>.wp-block-image&#91;class*=is-style-polaroid-tilt] {\n    transition: all 0.5s ease-in-out;\n}\n\n.wp-block-image&#91;class*=is-style-polaroid-tilt]:hover {\n    transform: scale( 1, 1 ) rotate( 0 );\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me know in the comments if you gave this block style a shot. If you really want to lean into the old-school Polaroid style, try it with a custom handwriting font for the caption.  Also, please share any custom image-related designs if you have them.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:45:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 6.0 Beta 3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12690\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/04/wordpress-6-0-beta-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5391:\"<p>WordPress 6.0 Beta 3 is now available for testing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This version of the WordPress software is under development</strong>.

It is one of the first managed hosts to offer a packaged product that handles all the dependencies and configuration required to launch a headless site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new add-on is called Atlas: Headless WP. It makes it easy for users to create  a site with a Node.js frontend that uses WP Engine&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/wpengine/faustjs\">Faust.js</a> headless framework for WordPress. It can be found inside the latest version of Local under the Add-ons menu. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The Atlas add-on watches any changes made to frontend code and compiles them after a file is saved. The add-on&#8217;s help docs have a guide to the folder structure for the headless sites it creates:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><code>app</code>&nbsp;– Contains the files of a typical WordPress site. Any changes made here will be reflected in the WordPress backend.</li><li><code>app-node</code>&nbsp;– The Javascript frontend which the Node.js process is watching and compiling.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The Atlas add-on gives users access to three blueprints that include starter code, plugins, content models, and page structure to jumpstart site development. One creates a barebones site with just the scaffolding necessary to get started. The <a href=\"https://ho9og0bwp1wgbx352zgxg3euj.js.wpenginepowered.com/\">second blueprint</a> is for a portfolio site and includes a blog and pages to list projects. The <a href=\"https://hmejg9kqfq27oh867on87bczn.js.wpenginepowered.com/\">third blueprint</a> appears to be very similar but just includes a blog and menu with no portfolio.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to note that Atlas can only be enabled on new sites in Local, as the app has no way to convert existing sites into a headless site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sites built using the add-on are supported in the import/export site workflows, but the company&#8217;s support team confirmed that Atlas sites can only be hosted at WP Engine. This is one of the chief drawbacks of the framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this reason, the Atlas add-on essentially functions sort of like a sales funnel for WP Engine, since sites produced using it are not portable to be hosted anywhere else. It does offer an easy way to experiment with headless WordPress to see how it all works together. It&#8217;s also convenient for WP Engine customers who want to use it to create new headless sites with less work setting up and configuring them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Atlas add-on for Local is still in beta, so it has a few rough edges. Users can get help for their support questions by creating a topic in the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://localwp.com/community/c/local-add-ons/atlas-headless-wp/31\" target=\"_blank\">Atlas: Headless WP</a> category of the community forums.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Correction</strong>: <em>WP Engine has confirmed its support team misspoke when saying Atlas sites can only be hosted at WP Engine, and Andy North, the company&#8217;s director of communications, offered the following statement: </em></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Sites that are spun up as Atlas Blueprints can be hosted anywhere.

The upcoming feature will allow theme designers to bundle multiple design presets. In turn, end-users can cycle through them, selecting their preferred look without changing their active theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been writing about the feature <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/skins-are-back-in-style-proposal-for-themes-to-bundle-user-selectable-design-variations\">since November 2021</a>, holding out some hope that it was going to land with WordPress 5.9. It did not ship with that release, but I have eagerly followed every related ticket since, knowing it would eventually come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In January, the feature was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-12-5-introduces-global-styles-variations-preserves-adjacent-button-styling-and-adds-alpha-transparency-to-color-pickers\">merged into the Gutenberg plugin</a>. That almost feels like an eternity in &#8220;tech time.&#8221; With everything else happening in the current WordPress 6.0 release cycle, it is easy to forget that it will be a flagship feature in just a few short weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I am being honest, I feel like I have been waiting for this my entire career in the WordPress space. I think I have always known I have wanted it without always being able to verbalize it. I was an early adopter of child themes and began using them when they were a feature only available via a third-party plugin. WordPress always seemed to be missing something between an entire theme and a child that made sense for developers and users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many theme authors have tackled this in one way or another. Some would package skins that users could pick from. Others presented preset color and font combinations. However, these methods were never standardized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Global style variations are the answer I have been searching for. The system provides theme authors an easy way to bundle multiple variants without shipping them as separate child themes. Themers merely need to drop custom <code>*.json</code> files in their theme&#8217;s <code>/styles</code> folder. These appear in the Global Styles panel in the site editor for users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty Twenty-Two will officially be the first default theme to ship these style variants. The plan was to bundle six styles but was recently pared down to four (including the default). The following are screenshots of the three new variations expected to land in the next version of the theme:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<img />\nBlue, Pink, and Swiss variations for Twenty Twenty-Two\n\n\n\n<p>These could change as we get closer to the WordPress 6.0 release, but they are the latest iteration. For others who want to test them, they are <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/2440\">available via a pull request</a> on the WordPress Develop GitHub repository. They have not been merged into the core code yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I had to pick a favorite, it would be the Pink variation. It is not something I would typically select, but the IBM Plex Mono font works well with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a fan of shipping fewer variations for the initial set. As Kjell Reigstad <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55433#comment:8\">said on the associated Trac ticket</a>, it should &#8220;help folks differentiate them even more strongly.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Twenty Twenty-Two will be the first default theme to implement global style variations, other theme authors have already been offering some choices for users. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/alara/\">Alara</a> ships seven additional styles, and <a href=\"https://frostwp.com/download/\">Frost</a> has a Dark Mode variant. Users can already test these alongside the WordPress 6.0 beta or with WordPress 5.9 and the Gutenberg plugin installed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Variations are primarily being used as a quick way for end-users to choose a preset design. This is a one-off choice, but I envision a broader scope for the feature in the coming months and years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using Frost&#8217;s Dark Mode as an example, I could eventually see that being tied to the site visitor&#8217;s settings, showing the variation their preferred scheme. <em>If someone is not already working on a plugin for this, they should be.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another possibility is that some site owners may want to have seasonal or event-based design tweaks that are easy to switch between. <em>It would be fun to see WordPress release a Christmas-based Twenty Twenty-Two variation later this year.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors who want to start bundling their own style variations should <a href=\"https://fullsiteediting.com/lessons/global-style-variations/\">read Carolina Nymark&#8217;s tutorial</a>.

Today marks another important date into our project&#8217;s history: BuddyPress is <strong>progressively</strong> moving towards using the <strong><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/handbook/rewrite/\">WordPress Rewrite API</a></strong> to create, manage, parse and customize every URL generated by the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-3 wp-block-buttons\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-background\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-rewrites/\">Get BP Rewrites</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-324321\"></span>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>The challenge</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We are fully aware doing this move is a HUGE change. We&#8217;ve been thinking about it since April 25, 2013. For 9 years, we&#8217;ve been postponing the <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4954\">issue</a> for many good reasons. The most important one is: many plugin authors are building features on top of the BuddyPress plugin &amp; they got used to our Legacy URL parser: changing habits can be challenging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why we chose the &#8220;feature as a plugin&#8221; way to progress and achieve this important move for end users &amp; us all. The <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/tag/rewrites/\">BP Rewrites project</a> started on August 13, 2021. It used to be only available on our GitHub place as a start and we quickly understood, due to the <strong>lack of contributions</strong>, we needed to make it easier for everyone interested in BuddyPress to get involved. It&#8217;s now directly available from the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#finding-plugins-1\">Plugins/Add new</a> menu of your WordPress dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are around <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/buddypress/\">1,000 BuddyPress plugins</a> hosted on the official WordPress.org Plugin directory and <strong>we really need your contribution (yes even you who&#8217;s reading these lines) to help us make sure most of them will enjoy this great change</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We believe <strong>the BuddyPress community</strong> (the BuddyPress team, the BuddyPress contributors, the BuddyPress end users, the BuddyPress plugin &amp; theme developers) <strong>can meet this challenge</strong> if we all collaborate together:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>End users</strong> can download, test and <strong>warn</strong> plugin &amp; theme developers if they find the corresponding plugin or theme is not behaving the same with &amp; without BP Rewrites.</li><li><strong>Plugin &amp; Theme developers</strong> can <strong>adapt</strong> their piece of art, thanks to the end users warnings. They can also suggest contributors to improve the existing backward compatibility already in place and of course contribute themselves to the BP Rewrites plugin.</li><li><strong>Contributors</strong> can <strong>advise</strong> Plugin &amp; Theme developers about how to adapt or <strong>code</strong> the needed BP Rewrites adjustments if necessary. They can also <strong>start documenting</strong> how to write BuddyPress plugins and themes to fully enjoy BP Rewrites.</li><li>The <strong>team</strong>, thanks to all above contributions, will be able to <strong>take the right decisions</strong>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Our end goal is to merge this feature into BuddyPress core. It will require us energy and time so that it finally happens the best for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>The benefits</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the BP Rewrites &#8220;feature as a plugin&#8221; you can already enjoy them <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64c.png\" alt=\"🙌\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>From a end user’s point of view: BuddyPress can run with or without pretty URL and if they chose pretty URL, <strong>they can customize every URL generated by BuddyPress</strong> to make them even more meaningful for their community site members (eg: use words of their native language).</li><li>From a developer’s point of view: the BuddyPress way of creating, managing &amp; parsing URL should be faster, more reliable, extensible, testable and fully compliant with WordPress best practices.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>The risks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, BP Rewrites is the way we chose to mitigate the risk of doing the BP Legacy URL Parser to the WP Rewrite API switch. The more we will be to test it, the more we&#8217;ll be able to eventually identify issues, fix them and improve the feature and the more reliable BuddyPress will be when the feature will be merged into its core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But end users may also wonder if it&#8217;s risky to test BP Rewrites for their community site. There&#8217;s always a risk when we choose to activate a plugin on a WordPress site. It&#8217;s always important to take a few seconds to prevent data alteration by first backing up your site&#8217;s database &amp; the <code>/wp-content</code> directory of your site. If things go wrong, you can simply use this backup to restore the previous state of your site. This precaution is not specific to the BP Rewrites plugin, you should always do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This being said, the BuddyPress team thinks the BP Rewrites is safe to test with BuddyPress 10.0 (or up). It&#8217;s easy to find back your community site the way it was by simply deactivating the plugin. The most serious damage that could happen is that you could lose the ability to edit the WordPress pages you defined as BuddyPress directory roots. In this case, you simply need to perform the page mapping once again from the &#8220;Pages&#8221; tab of the BuddyPress settings administration screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life.</p><cite><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali\">Muhammad Ali</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What BP Rewrites changes?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>FYI, once activated, The BP Rewrites plugin is editing the post type of the existing BuddyPress pages in favor of the&nbsp;<code>buddypress</code>&nbsp;post type. That’s why you don’t see the BuddyPress pages&nbsp;<s>anymore</s>&nbsp;(as long as the BP Rewrites plugin is active) into the corresponding WordPress Administration edit screen. The BuddyPress&nbsp;<strong>Pages</strong>&nbsp;settings screen is replaced by a BuddyPress&nbsp;<strong>URLs</strong>&nbsp;settings screen.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<a href=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2022/04/screenshot-1.png\"><img width=\"1018\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2022/04/screenshot-1-1018x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-324335\" /></a><em>The BuddyPress&nbsp;<strong>URLs</strong>&nbsp;settings screen</em></div>\n\n\n<p>This last screen is where you define custom slugs for the URL generated by BuddyPress. These slugs are saved as a post meta of the corresponding BuddyPress post type/page item. Then the BP Rewrites plugin is taking benefit from the BuddyPress hooks/APIs to change BP Core’s behavior.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you deactivate the plugin,&nbsp;<code>buddypress</code>&nbsp;post type’s items are switched back to regular pages and you get them back into the corresponding WordPress Administration edit screen. Post metas are still there in case you want to activate BP Rewrites back (this can happen when you’re testing another BuddyPress plugin). If you absolutely want to get rid of these post metas, you can delete the BuddyPress pages, create new ones and redo the page mapping from the BuddyPress Pages settings screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Many thanks to BP Rewrites first contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/oztaser/\">Adil Öztaşer (oztaser)</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/boonebgorges/\">Boone B Gorges (boonebgorges)</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/eha1\">Eric (eha1)</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/imath/\">Mathieu Viet (imath)</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/r-a-y/\">r-a-y</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/shanebp/\">shanebp</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get BP Rewrites</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-7 wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-4 wp-block-column\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-5 wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-rewrites/\">BP Rewrites</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-6 wp-block-column\"></div>\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 24 Apr 2022 16:01:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Mathieu Viet\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"Gutenberg Times: Webfonts API, Accessibility Improvements, WordPress 6.0, and more – Weekend Edition 212\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=20986\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:110:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/webfonts-api-accessibility-improvements-wordpress-6-0-and-more-weekend-edition-212/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21167:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Greetings from the US again.

If you’ve tried it out, you’ll notice that it was released with a&nbsp;<code>beta</code>&nbsp;label on its menu to indicate it’s in an early stage and that it needs feedback from people like you to evolve it. As people have begun exploring, though, questions abound: Who is full site editing for? Why is it missing XYZ feature? Will it meet my needs? Why was it released now when it isn’t yet fully formed?

While not as popular as some of the other projects he has spearheaded, such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/editorplus/\">Editor Plus</a>, he wanted to breathe some fresh life into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The original plugin allowed users to insert a slider block and create the slides directly from the post or page editor. The new approach is similar. However, end-users can only edit it from a new &#8220;Block Slider&#8221; post type.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Creating a slide in the block slider.\n\n\n\n<p>Existing users should note that the new version breaks compatibility with their old galleries. It would be wise to make a backup to revert to if necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kamal listed several benefits to the updated approach:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A clean and wider slide editing/creation interface. Comparatively, the &#8216;block&#8217; had less room to work with.</li><li>The fact we have a separate interface/post type, I took the opportunity to modify it a bit to make the slide creation easier for users.</li><li>This approach lets users create and manage sliders easily from one place (post type) compared to in-page block.</li><li>Using the slider to multiple pages/posts is easier with this approach.</li><li>The best part and the most important reason is that the slider can be used outside Gutenberg editor or anywhere with any page builder using the shortcode (or I could provide more ways to use it in the future).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the user, some of those can be advantages. However, for others, they are not. For example, not all websites would benefit from a dedicated slider management admin screen. Sometimes, a one-off slider is all that is wanted for something like the front page. The new approach creates more work and adds an unnecessary admin menu for those use cases. For users who add multiple sliders to their sites, it should simplify management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kamal touts using the block shortcode anywhere, but this feels like a step back from the earlier version of the plugin. It is now impossible to see what a slider looks like mixed with page content without previewing it on the front end. When laying out a full-page design via the editor, having the live preview can be vital to putting it all together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I am working on a block that lets you insert a slider (and maybe do a bit more),&#8221; Kamal said when I questioned him on the implementation. &#8220;It should be out in the next update soon.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the user experience of creating and customizing sliders feels smooth. It is easy to attach new slides via the &#8220;Add Slide&#8221; button fixed to the bottom of the screen and navigate to others.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding multiple image slides.\n\n\n\n<p>Other than a minor spacing issue where the right navigation arrow butted against the side of the screen, I had no trouble using it. It worked well in the editor and on the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block Slider has a <a href=\"https://wpblockslider.com/\">commercial version</a> that begins at $29 per year. It includes updates and support for one site. There are also five-site and unlimited tiers for $49 and $99, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, most users will likely not need the upgrade. Other than a handful of options, including a carousel view and a few customizations, most features are in the free version. And the plugin does not lack out-of-the-box options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If anything, the number of settings is almost dizzying. Users who want ultimate customizability should enjoy tinkering with the design tools. Those who prefer a scaled-back interface can always leave the defaults in place. Otherwise, diving into them can be overwhelming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kamal shared an intro video to the plugin that barely scratches the surface of what the plugin can do:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I like where Kamal seems to be going with the plugin. His target audience focuses on users who love plenty of options and an easy way to manage their sliders. For one-off use cases, it is best to look elsewhere. Some bits still feel a little rough, like using a shortcode when placing the slider on a page, but that can always be addressed later.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-slider/\">WordPress Slider Plugin &#8211; Block Slider</a></blockquote>\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 23 Apr 2022 02:26:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:120:\"WPTavern: WordCamp US Trials New Program Connecting Underrepresented Speakers with Sponsors for Travel and Lodging Costs\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=133519\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:131:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-trials-new-program-connecting-underrepresented-speakers-with-sponsors-for-travel-and-lodging-costs\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3829:\"<p>WordCamp US, scheduled for September 9-11 in San Diego, is <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2022/support-underrepresented-speakers-at-wordcamp-us/\">trialing a new program</a> that would connect speakers from underrepresented groups with companies that agree to sponsor their travel and lodging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;To improve diverse representation at WordCamp US (WCUS), our Programming Team has looked into the barriers that hold different groups back, the largest of which is the cost of hotel and airfare/travel,&#8221; WCUS organizers wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While WCUS can’t cover these costs, we can set up a connecting point between these speakers and companies that would like to support them.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordCamp is calling for interested companies to get in touch so they can be matched with speakers who need financial support.

This is mirrored in the WordPress community when contributors forgo participation in community events due to income limitations. Participation in events requires a community member to personally pay for travel and lodging expenses or personally network for sponsorships to cover these expenses.</p><p>Transparently integrating travel and lodging sponsorships after a Call for Speakers submission selection would breakdown a notable barrier to inclusion that exists for many underrepresented/minority groups around the world – financial costs.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>MasterWP editor Rob Howard continued this conversation, referencing Hughes&#8217; call to action, in a recent <a href=\"https://masterwp.com/wordcamp-speakers-need-to-get-paid/\">post</a> that advocates for all speakers and organizers being paid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The largest and most obvious barrier to attending and speaking at WordCamp is money,&#8221; Howard said. &#8220;In order to offer a truly equal opportunity to everyone, the WordPress Foundation needs to set aside enough money to pay for the airfare and lodging of every speaker and organizer, period. Anything less than this privileges people who work for WordPress companies or people who have the disposable income for a random trip to San Diego.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Howard contends that this approach should not be a separate initiative but &#8220;should simply become how WordCamp works.&#8221; Yesterday MasterWP announced its own <a href=\"https://masterwp.com/wordcamp-us-2022-sponsorship/\">sponsorship program</a>. The team intends to sponsor at least six speakers and organizers to cover the costs of travel, meals, and lodging. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, Winstina Hughes worked with the WCUS speaker programming team to make speaker sponsorships a real possibility. Organizers will facilitate the connection between interested companies and selected speakers who are seeking sponsorship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp US has also <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2022/wordcamp-us-call-for-speakers-extended/\">extended its call for speakers</a>. It appears organizers may not have received enough diverse applicants, as they said their purpose in extending the call is  &#8220;to showcase our community’s variety and diversity.&#8221; The updated deadline is Monday, April 25.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 19:11:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"Post Status: Post Status Notes #495\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=96264\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-notes-495/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11896:\"<div class=\"wp-container-7 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">Lots of core news this week! <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f34e.png\" alt=\"🍎\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> WCUS calls on companies to support inclusion. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f4aa.png\" alt=\"💪\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Plus the latest cool finds, learning guides, and good ideas. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f4a5.png\" alt=\"💥\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> </p></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-spacer aligncenter kt-block-spacer-_f5fe16-0a\"><div class=\"kt-block-spacer kt-block-spacer-halign-center\"><hr class=\"kt-divider\" /></div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"core-news\" class=\"kt-adv-heading_e2e4d2-13 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Core News</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WordPress 6.0 Beta 2</strong> is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/04/wordpress-6-0-beta-2/\">available for testing</a>.

It was not something I had set out to do. I did not wake up one day and declare, &#8220;I think I will build a suite of custom block types over the next few days.&#8221; It just happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first plugin I built was to address an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/32836\">old ticket for Gutenberg</a> that had not seen any traction. Perhaps others were not interested in the idea, or it never crossed their path in the sea of 1,000s of other tickets. <em>Why not just build it myself?</em> So, I did. It took a couple of hours, but much of that time was re-configuring the <code>@wordpress/scripts</code> build script to my liking and reading docs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that plugin out of the way, I started seeking new problems to solve. One that was already on my radar was the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/40264\">missing Comments Title block</a> necessary to bring the upcoming Comments Query Loop block to feature parity before WordPress 6.0 lands. So, I built a rough plugin for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Comments Title block in the site editor.\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, others took that initial idea and ran with it, building something far more flexible than my first attempt. Now, there is a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40419\">new block in Gutenberg</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a couple of other itches I wanted to scratch, and there was little to do on a rain-filled Sunday. Namely, WordPress does not include equivalent blocks for the <code>wp_list_users()</code> and <code>wp_list_authors()</code> template tags. That seemed like an oversight, so I tackled early versions of those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will put these up for free on the official WordPress plugin directory soon for folks interested in them. I can only hope they will help someone else in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This post is about sharing my experience, the journey, rather than what became of it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, someone asked whether I could operate in this JavaScript-heavy world of blocks as a developer. It has been over two years since I took on a writing position here at WP Tavern and developed real-world solutions for users. I was only starting to use JavaScript with the block editor back then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, I have dabbled with block themes, even releasing one on WordPress.org. I have built a few PHP-based projects for fun in my spare time. I even created my first custom block plugin last summer and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/taking-the-leap-building-my-first-wordpress-block-plugin\">shared my experience with readers</a>. Shortly after, I built a second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That burning flame I had nearly a year ago quickly died down. That had more to do with the state of block theme development, which was still in its infancy, than anything. I was excited about its potential, but consistent breakage was more than I had time to deal with, considering all of it was a fun side project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At heart, I am still a programmer, a problem solver. So, I began anew.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first stop was the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/javascript/js-build-setup/\">JavaScript Build Setup documentation</a> for building blocks. I was going to learn the &#8220;WordPress way&#8221; this time around. For the most part, I followed through with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only hiccup I had was the setup script snake-casing my namespace, <code>x3p0</code>, into <code>x_3_p_0</code> in function names. That was a mess to clean up. However, I did not need to go through that process in other block plugins. I just wanted the beginner experience on the first go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For building blocks, <code><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-scripts/\">@wordpress/scripts</a></code> is all that is necessary. I tinkered with it, added a couple of custom commands, and modified the input/output folders. However, it has everything needed to get up and running fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I skipped past the <em>Hola, mundo!</em> (Hello, world!) portion of the setup tutorial. Whenever I set out to build anything, I plan to dive headfirst into something a bit more complex. However, it never hurts to get the basics down to see how things work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My style of programming is one built upon failure. I venture out with an idea, fail miserably, and continue learning from my mistakes. A short while later, I had a custom block type that showed a link back to a nested comment&#8217;s parent:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Comment parent link block.\n\n\n\n<p>While that was a success, I have learned that some other built-in editor components might make it even better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That first block gave me a taste of modern development on WordPress. It was a relatively simple plugin to build, but it was easy to see how one could expand it out to more complex features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The components system has grown into a robust and flexible toolset for developers over these last few years. Plus, <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/components/\">the component-level documentation</a> is well-rounded at this point, especially when pairing it with usage in the core code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I continued building new blocks, I started taking on more complex concepts. One of the things I needed to learn was how to interact with the core data layer. As I stepped into my third and fourth block types, I needed to query users and list them:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Listing users via an Authors block.\n\n\n\n<p>While there is a <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/data-basics/\">&#8220;basics&#8221; tutorial</a> on working with core data, the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/data/data-core/\">reference guide</a> was spotty in places. Some pieces even seemed to be missing altogether. <em>Where were the advanced guides?</em> I could not find any, and &#8220;doing stuff&#8221; with data is the meat of plugin development when you get beyond a few simple form fields.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spent some time with the tried and true <code>console.log()</code> to figure out things and perused the core code. Eventually, I pushed through and built a couple of working projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Did my experience improve this time around compared to a year ago?</em> Without a doubt, it did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than anything, I want to thank all the contributors to the Gutenberg project. The build tools and range of pre-built components are welcome for this developer who has spent most of his time in the PHP world. I always enjoy being able to pick up a toolset and start building with it right away. I am sure I have only glimpsed some of what is possible at this point, but I look forward to trying new things. As I grow more comfortable, maybe I will write some of those advanced tutorials that I believe are missing.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 02:59:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"Post Status: WordPress Podcast and Video Picks for the Week of April 11\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=96253\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-podcast-and-video-picks-for-the-week-of-april-11/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3908:\"<div class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">Talk about #MentalHealth!

Manipulating them with code snippets or custom plugins is even tougher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today\'s core function (<code>get_variation_prices</code>) will definitely help you save time while working with prices, custom notices, conditional logic and such.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As usual, we\'ll study the function code, take a look at its usage, and finally analyze a case study that will come in useful sooner or later. Enjoy!</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-96369\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-function-code\">Function Code</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find <code>get_variation_prices under \\woocommerce\\includes\\class-wc-product-variable.php</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/**\n * Get an array of all sale and regular prices from all variations. This is used for example when displaying the price range at variable product level or seeing if the variable product is on sale.\n *\n * @param  bool $for_display If true, prices will be adapted for display based on the `woocommerce_tax_display_shop` setting (including or excluding taxes).\n * @return array Array of RAW prices, regular prices, and sale prices with keys set to variation ID.\n */\n \npublic function get_variation_prices( $for_display = false ) {\n	$prices = $this-&gt;data_store-&gt;read_price_data( $this, $for_display );\n\n	foreach ( $prices as $price_key =&gt; $variation_prices ) {\n		$prices&#91; $price_key ] = $this-&gt;sort_variation_prices( $variation_prices );\n	}\n\n	return $prices;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>By reading the comments, we can see this function returns an <strong>array of prices for each variation</strong> for a product. This is handy — you don\'t need to loop over variations yourself!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also mentions a parameter, <code>$for_display</code>, which if set to &#8216;true\' can return prices according to the store\'s tax settings — including or excluding tax, based on whatever option you picked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the function code, we see two statements:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><code>read_price_data</code> clearly gets prices [regular, sale and display] from all variation IDs.</li><li><code>sort_variation_prices</code> is not so clear — but it sorts the returned array from lowest to greatest price. This is helpful when you need to get the min or the max value, for example, as you can just read the first or the last array values!</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>Function Usage</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As long as you have access to the <code>$product global</code> (in a product loop, on the single product page, in the admin, etc.), you can call <code>get_variation_prices</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the product must be a variable one, otherwise the function will return an empty array. (Or maybe an error, who knows? Post a comment if you want to send me some feedback about this.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be sure we\'re on the single product page and I\'m looking at a variable product, we can use the <code>woocommerce_before_variations_form</code> hook — evidently this triggers only there and then:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>add_action( \'woocommerce_before_variations_form\', \'bbloomer_get_variation_prices\' );\n\nfunction bbloomer_get_variation_prices() {\n	global $product;\n	echo \'&lt;pre&gt;\';\n	print_r( $product-&gt;get_variation_prices() );\n	echo \'&lt;/pre&gt;\';\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Result:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"752\" height=\"519\" src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-1-752x519.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-96370\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the grey box (preformatted text thanks to the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> HTML tag), we find the <code>get_variation_prices</code> output: <strong>a multidimensional array with 3 keys</strong> (<em>price, regular price, sale price</em>) <strong>and array values</strong> (<em>variation ID =&gt; price amount</em>) <strong>sorted by price amount</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Super handy!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lazy tip alert!

A sampling of the upcoming major events include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>WordCamp Vienna, Austria (April 23, 2022)</li><li>WordCamp Irun (May 21–22, 2022)</li><li>WordCamp Europe (June 2–4, 2022)</li><li>WordCamp Warsaw, Poland (June 11–12, 2022)</li><li>WordCamp Montclair, (June 25, 2022)</li><li>WordCamp Netherlands (September 15–16, 2022)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress&#8217; Community Team published an <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2022/04/21/announcement-updated-covid-19-guidelines-for-official-wordpress-events/\">updated set of COVID-19 guidelines</a> today ahead of a the five WordCamps that will be happening over the next few months. There are a few notable changes from the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-team-updates-covid-19-safety-guidelines-to-relieve-volunteers-of-enforcement-burden\">previous guidelines</a>, which mandated that organizers select a venue with staff that can check temperatures and vaccination status and remind attendees to wear masks. This removed the enforcement burden from volunteers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated guidelines require organizers follow local guidelines, provide masks and hand sanitizer, and provide a sticker to attendees that indicates if they prefer others to wear a mask when conversing in close proximity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Community Team strongly recommended the following for attendees:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>We still recommend that you wear a mask while at in-person WordPress events.</li><li>If you see that someone is wearing a sticker requesting people wear a mask near them, please wear a mask while within 6 feet (2 meters) of them or keep your distance.</li><li>A request that you only attend in-person if you are vaccinated or have recently tested negative.</li><li>Please stay at home if you are sick or have recently come in contact with someone who is ill.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Ten days prior to publishing the updated guidelines, the Community Team requested feedback in a post that asked the question, &#8220;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2022/04/11/return-to-in-person-events-share-your-challenges/\">What is keeping you from either organizing or attending an in-person event?</a>&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Birmingham organizer Ryan Marks responded, saying his team was restricted from organizing in-person events (under the previous guidelines). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My location doesn’t allow for the checking of vaccination status,&#8221; Marks said. &#8220;So we must answer yes to all of the In-person safety checklist items. It hasn’t been possible to answer yes to the first two questions yet.&#8221; The checklist required the area’s average positive case rate to average under 4% for 28 days, and to have under 50 new cases reported per 100,000 people for 14 days, among other requirements. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marks and his team were forced to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-birmingham-postponed-due-to-rising-local-covid-19-infection-rates\">postpone WordCamp Birmingham</a> in January after Omicron hit Alabama and local infections began rising. The camp had previously been criticized for its initial <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220105003454/https://birmingham.wordcamp.org/2022/faq/\">masking policy</a>, which stated “Masks are required for entry and preferred throughout the event.&#8221; This set off heated discussions on social media, where concerned community members <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mor10/status/1478790408482164737\">condemned the gathering as “irresponsible.&#8221;</a> The camp revised its masking guidelines to require masks indoors but ultimately had to postpone due to local conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated guidelines from WordPress&#8217; Community Team bear a striking similarity to WordCamp Birmingham&#8217;s original masking policy &#8211; if the local authorities do not have requirements in place, masks are optional but recommended.  It has been <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/masking-science-sars-cov2.html\">well-documented</a> that indoor masking can significantly reduce transmission, so the Community Team must have witnessed a major change in pandemic conditions to amend the guidelines to make them optional. With the exception of a handful of flagship events, WordPress has ultimately decided to leave the requirements to local authorities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As flagship events are larger and draw an international crowd, both WordCamp Europe and WordCamp US organizers were asked to view these as minimum requirements and are expected to have a more comprehensive plan in place,&#8221; WordPress community organizer Angela Jin said in today&#8217;s announcement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Europe will require masks indoors and social distancing at the speakers dinner. They are creating self-service registration booths and trying to put more activities, like WP Cafe, outdoors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp US will be following San Diego&#8217;s local guidelines in September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We will require all attendees to be vaccinated or have recently tested negative,&#8221; Jin said. &#8220;Additionally, due to the size and nature of this event, masks will be required to be worn over both the mouth and nose while indoors. Hand sanitizer and masks will also be available and some activities, such as lunch, will be outdoors.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 21:16:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"Do The Woo Community: Build Your Developer Network, Career and Business\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=71280\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://dothewoo.io/build-your-developer-network-career-and-business/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:421:\"<p>Whether you are looking to grow or change your WordPress or WooCommerce development career, here are some tips from Marcus and Courtney.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/build-your-developer-network-career-and-business/\">Build Your Developer Network, Career and Business</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 09:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: A Pared Back Web Fonts API May Land in WordPress 6.0 or Not at All\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=133397\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"https://wptavern.com/a-pared-back-web-fonts-api-may-land-in-wordpress-6-0-or-not-at-all\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5700:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Anyone who has been watching or participating in the development of the web fonts API can attest that it has been an emotional rollercoaster. At one point, it seemed to be a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/a-web-font-api-possibly-coming-to-wordpress\">shoo-in for WordPress 5.9</a>. Then, it was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/proposed-web-fonts-api-not-coming-to-wordpress-5-9-possibly-landing-in-gutenberg-first\">punted to the next release</a>. Sure that it was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-web-fonts-api-has-arrived\">landing once again</a>, we find ourselves looking down the track, wondering just where the next dip or twist will take us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the weekend, I had a sense of dread. The WordPress 6.0 Beta 1 release last week felt premature. I am just as excited about the next major update as I have been about any before. There are tons of noteworthy features. It is OK for some of them to not be polished for a beta release, but the problem was the list of incomplete and missing pieces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision to postpone the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/24952\">Post Author Name block</a> left me scratching my head. It is an obvious pairing for the new Post Author Biography block and almost feels necessary for Author Template support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Comments Query Loop block, a replacement for Post Comments, was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-comment-related-blocks-arriving-with-wordpress-6-0\">missing vital features</a>. Fortunately, most of those seemed squared away now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, there was the web fonts API. I had not paid it much attention since its inclusion in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-12-8-launches-the-web-fonts-api-improves-group-nesting-and-adds-keyboard-shortcut-for-links\">Gutenberg 12.8</a> over a month ago. I was happy to see it merged and have used it ever since. However, there has been some trouble brewing that might spoil its inclusion in the 6.0 release. It was notably missing from the first beta, and there was no final decision on its status as Beta 2 rolled out yesterday. There are still several open, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%5BPriority%5D+High%22+label%3A%22%5BFeature%5D+Webfonts%22+\">high-priority tickets</a> for the API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of the problematic features was tied to other highlights of the upcoming 6.0 release, and the web fonts API is intrinsically linked to what is, arguably, the <em>crème de la crème</em> of the bunch: <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/global-style-variations-skins-for-themes-have-landed-in-gutenberg\">global style variations</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First touted before the release of WordPress 5.9 and its accompanying default theme, global style variations would allow end-users to switch between pre-built &#8220;skins.&#8221; Twenty Twenty-Two would showcase the feature in all its wonder:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Potential variations on Twenty Twenty-Two.\n\n\n\n<p>However, the feature did not make the cut. That was OK because the web fonts API did not squeeze in either. These variations would allow theme authors to mix and match different colors, block styles, and fonts. Like a PB&amp;J without the J, the global style variations feature is a fine meal in its own right, but fonts offer a variety of flavors that users deserve to taste. If we wait for some future release toward the end of the year, Twenty Twenty-Two might feel like old news by then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After WordPress 6.0 Beta 2&#8217;s release, it has become crunch time for this long-awaited feature that standardizes how fonts are loaded in WordPress. One truth is almost set in stone: the complete API will be deferred to a future release. However, there is a sliver of hope for theme authors that a <code>theme.json</code>-only version will be available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya Mork has opened a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/40472\">ticket for paring down the feature</a> to disallow programmatically registering and enqueueing fonts. Along with work by Ari Stathopoulos, the associated <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40493\">pull request on GitHub</a> would still allow theme authors to define custom font-faces via <code>theme.json</code> and custom <code>/styles/*.json</code> files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a compromise on a robust API that many have been waiting for, but it is necessary. Yet, there are still no guarantees, and the patch needs testing from theme authors sooner rather than later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As much as I want the web fonts API to land in 6.0, I would be remiss to not point out that April 12, the release date of Beta 1, was the &#8220;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/03/11/wordpress-6-0-planning-update/\">effective feature freeze.</a>&#8221; Essentially, this is the deadline for new features for the release cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having these deadlines in place is not arbitrary. They give time for users to test and report bugs. They allow theme and plugin developers to make sure their extensions are working. When new features start landing in Beta 3 and Release Candidates, it can sometimes be a mad scramble to catch up in an already fast-paced cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a certain point, WordPress must abide by its own rules. Otherwise, it feels like some pet features get a pass where others might not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The web fonts API is one of those things I would not mind breaking the rules for. My only argument is that it is such an integral piece of global style variations that I cannot imagine having one and not the other.

This is currently available in the nightly version of Brave.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>De-AMP is available in the Nightly and Beta versions of the browser and will be turned on by default in the next official release for desktop and Android, with a debut on iOS following after.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly after Brave published its announcement, DuckDuckGo tweeted that its apps and extensions now also support bypassing AMP pages in favor of the publisher&#8217;s original URL. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;AMP technology is bad for privacy because it enables Google to track users even more (which is already a ton),&#8221; DuckDuckGo tweeted. &#8220;And, Google uses AMP to further entrench its monopoly, forcing the technology on publishers by prioritizing AMP links in search and favoring Google ads on AMP pages.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">AMP technology is bad for privacy because it enables Google to track users even more (which is already a ton). <br /><br />And, Google uses AMP to further entrench its monopoly, forcing the technology on publishers by prioritizing AMP links in search and favoring Google ads on AMP pages.</p>&mdash; DuckDuckGo (@DuckDuckGo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DuckDuckGo/status/1516535049671397379?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 19, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Firefox has not announced plans to begin rerouting AMP pages, but Firefox users interested in having this feature can use the <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/amp2html/\">Redirect AMP to HTML</a> add-on. <a href=\"https://www.daniel.priv.no/web-extensions/\">Daniel Aleksandersen</a>, the add-on&#8217;s creator, developed it to &#8220;keep the web decentralized&#8221; and deny information to &#8220;search engines that want to take control over the web.&#8221; It is used by more than 5,800 Firefox users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Large publishers have been moving away from AMP after Google stopped requiring the framework for placement in its Top Stories carousel. The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/publishers-move-to-abandon-google-supported-mobile-web-initiative-11645725640\">reports</a> that Vox Media LLC (Verge, Vox and New York Magazine), Buzzfeed&#8217;s Complex Networks (Complex and Sole Collector), and BDG (parent company of  Bustle, Gawker, Nylon and W.), have all begun testing or considering leaving AMP in favor of their own mobile-optimized pages. The Washington Post abandoned AMP in 2021. The publications&#8217; executives anticipate that leaving AMP will give them more control over their mobile pages, ad formats, better prices for their ad space, and a better chance for paywalled sites to grow their subscriber bases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Media executives now have a clearer picture of how Google intends to benefit from AMP after the DOJ&#8217;s unredacted complaint <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/amp-has-irreparably-damaged-publishers-trust-in-google-led-initiatives\">revealed that AMP pages brought 40% less revenue to publishers</a>. The December 2020 lawsuit referenced internal documents obtained from Google showing that AMP&#8217;s speed benefits “were also at least partly a result of Google’s throttling. Google throttles the load time of non-AMP ads by giving them artificial one-second delays in order to give Google AMP a ‘nice comparative boost.‘”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the wake of these revelations, and AMP no longer being required for the Top Stories carousel, publishers who adopted AMP, often at an enormous cost to themselves, are venturing out to see if they can better monetize their sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are one of the 500,000+ publishers who have invested in using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/\">official AMP plugin for WordPress</a>, it&#8217;s important to know that not all visitors will see AMP pages. The plugin&#8217;s Standard mode has only one theme that serves requests to a single AMP version of the website. As anti-AMP sentiment grows, and more apps, browsers, search engines, and users adopt ways to block or bypass AMP pages, it will become increasingly more important to maintain the non-AMP version of a website alongside the AMP version. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 00:48:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"Post Status: This Week at WordPress.org (April 18, 2022)\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=96326\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://poststatus.com/this-week-at-wordpress-org-april-18-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8950:\"<p>Each week we are highlighting the news from WordPress.org that you don\'t want to miss.

Head over to WP tavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox and use the contact form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Cate DeRosia. Cate is a familiar face in the WordPress community. Along with her husband Topher they run the HeroPress Network, which aims to make it easy to find any and all WordPress related content. She describes herself as a serial volunteer in the community. In early 2022, KCate was hired by Automattic to be a sponsored member of the community team. And it&#8217;s this role, which finds her on the podcast today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In-person events have been largely non-existent for the last two years. Many events have moved online and tried to keep the momentum going. But for some, it&#8217;s just not the same. In-person events, bring something unique to the table. There&#8217;s something special about interacting, face-to-face, sharing ideas and friendship in a way that&#8217;s virtually impossible on a screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years ago, if you were attending a WordPress meetup or WordCamp, it&#8217;s likely that you didn&#8217;t think too much about your safety at the event. You showed up, enjoyed the presentations and social spaces, and then went home. But now we&#8217;re all changed. Now both attendees and organizers need to make sure that the events are safe. That they are following local guidelines and have thought through all the consequences of gathering many people in one space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a lot to take on, but at the same time, it&#8217;s a golden opportunity to imagine afresh what a WordCamp might be. Cate wants to make this moment count, and she needs your help. Your ideas. On the podcast today, we talk about her blue sky thinking post, which is a forum for people to engage with her and her team, so that events can be made different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What does the community of 2022 want from WordPress events? Are we happy with how things have always been done or do we want something new, something different? Cate talks about how your opinions are being gathered and how they can shape the future of WordPress events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading over to WP tavern.com forward slash podcast. Where you&#8217;ll also find all the other podcast episodes. And so, without further delay, I bring you Cate DeRosia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Cate DeRosia Hello Cate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:56] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> Hello, Nathan. It&#8217;s so nice to talk with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And you too. Typically at the beginning of the podcast, just to give a bit of orientation we ask people to tell the listeners who they are and what their relationship is with WordPress. So I&#8217;m going to do the same thing. If you don&#8217;t mind Cate, just tell us a little bit about you and how it is that you&#8217;re appearing on a WordPress podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:16] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> That is a really excellent question. So I&#8217;ve been a serial volunteer in the community since about 2015. I really dove in deep there. I was transitioning away from homeschooling the girls to whatever I was going to do next with my life. My husband&#8217;s a veteran developer and had kind of made his home in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it made sense for me, I have an English degree. I really love the soft side of business communications and community. And that was kind of lacking in WordPress at the time. And so I started looking around at things you could do, jobs you could have in WordPress that didn&#8217;t involve development or design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was, it&#8217;s been a pretty interesting journey in kind of, invigorating for other people who have been in the community for a while and are looking for a change maybe. I&#8217;ve done a lot of freelance writing some community engagement, and then recently as of January, I was hired by Automattic to be a sponsored member of the community team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I couldn&#8217;t be more thrilled with that position. It really sets me up nicely to help the community. I&#8217;m also part of the Heropress project, which has been growing by leaps and bounds lately. We moved from our inspirational essays to a whole network of other services for the community, basically. So I&#8217;ve been very, very active for quite a while on the community side of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think if it&#8217;s okay with you before we get into the main event of the podcast, the discussion that we&#8217;re going to have, I&#8217;d really be interested to know what the role that you&#8217;ve taken on at Automattic, what that involves. You said that it was community focused, but you able to just give us some kind of insight into the kind of thing that you are doing on a day-to-day basis to help swell and build that community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:56] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> Yeah, I&#8217;m really glad you asked because it&#8217;s a hidden job in a way. Aside from the fact that my benefits and paycheck come from Automattic, I don&#8217;t work for Automattic. I work exclusively for the WordPress community through.org. I&#8217;m on a team of eight, which actually just doubled. So at the beginning of the year, we brought on four new team members, including myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We handle all of the paperwork behind having an event. So all of the finances for WordCamps, every WordCamp comes through us. We vet organizers for both meetups and WordCamps. And we have these do action events, to make sure that they represent the WordPress community. That they&#8217;re somebody that you would feel comfortable having your work behind. We also then have room in our time, in our days to work on a variety of projects that are important to us. I&#8217;m currently one of the lead trio for WordCamp US, and I&#8217;m doing a lot of work in kind of reactivating our blogs, which is why we&#8217;re talking today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m starting to use them more to create conversations with the community. To kind of bridge a gap that&#8217;s always been there. To help the community feel a little more, heard to give them an opportunity to share their opinions a little bit more. Others on my team are working with Jill Binder&#8217;s WP Diversity initiative, and bringing that more fully into the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another one is highly active in translations and helping to get WordPress out in languages as possible. And then a fourth member of my team is excellent at documentation. And she&#8217;s been really going in and making it easier for people who want to organize an event to come on board and do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That gives us a really perfect insight into why you&#8217;re talking today because the subject under discussion really is about the re-introduction of WordPress live events. Now I don&#8217;t suppose anybody needs to be told why we haven&#8217;t had live events for the last period of time. We haven&#8217;t. Several years have gone past, but it looks, at the time of recording, which is in April, 2022, it looks as if the world is settling down and considering going back to in-person events. And so that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to be talking about today. We&#8217;re going to be talking about some of the questions Cate is posing to the community, and ways that you can help answer those questions and give Cate and her team insights into what the future of WordPress events might look like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just before we get into that, just wondering if you could illustrate for us what it is that you think the world has been missing over the last couple of years. We know that we did our best. We went online and probably of any community on the planet, we were able to make that pivot. We had the technology and the websites and the infrastructure, good to go. But nevertheless, after a couple of years, I think it&#8217;s fair to say that people, given the chance, many of them would prefer to go back to real world events. And I&#8217;m just wondering, perhaps we could take this in the broad sweep, any ideas that you&#8217;ve had from friends, but maybe it&#8217;s a personal story. What do you think we&#8217;ve been missing ever since in-person events got pulled?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:03] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> You know, I love that question and it&#8217;s been on my mind since Topher and I had the opportunity to go to The State of the Word, in New York for HeroPress. Backing up a little bit, if there hadn&#8217;t been online events when I was getting started in WordPress, I would have had a really hard time getting started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was still being a full-time mom. I didn&#8217;t have a job, so I didn&#8217;t have a budget for travel. We were always a single income family, so there wasn&#8217;t extra money for anything. And so if I hadn&#8217;t been able to attend some things virtually, I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to learn as much as I did and have the start that I had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s an introvert myself, that always seemed like a good fit. You know, I liked having online events where I could just listen and learn from. But as we&#8217;ve gone through the pandemic and the real isolation that comes from being really cut off from people, you start to see how important it is to be able to see somebody&#8217;s face when you&#8217;re talking to them. A lot of trust is built in the non-verbals, and so it matters a lot to be able to sit down across from somebody and see what they&#8217;re really saying, not just the words that are coming out of their mouth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even beyond that, I was thinking about like, why did we go to New York? There are 50 of us that went there for the State of the Word, because I could sit at home and watch the State of the Word. I didn&#8217;t have to fly. I didn&#8217;t have to risk my health. You know, I didn&#8217;t have to do that. And I realized that it&#8217;s not the event itself, and you hear this a lot. The hallway track is the, you know, the thing everybody loves about a WordCamp. But why? And it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s a place where the other things get discussed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you&#8217;re sitting around a table with somebody and you&#8217;ve been there for an hour. You moved away from the conference talk completely, and have started brainstorming. You&#8217;ve started looking at your business from a different perspective. You&#8217;re thinking about community from a different perspective. There&#8217;s conversations flowing around you and you pick up these little bits and pieces that you don&#8217;t even know you&#8217;re going to use, but eventually down the road, you&#8217;re like, oh, Hey, I remember this person&#8217;s good at that thing, because I heard them talking about it over here. And it wasn&#8217;t even a conversation you were involved in and sometimes it completely revolutionizes your life. And so it&#8217;s never one thing that makes in-person events so important, but it&#8217;s like those little tiny bits and pieces of things that you can&#8217;t get unless you&#8217;re in a relaxed environment where you can just talk to each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s a really interesting insight because many people might think that the sessions themselves are the thing. Many people clearly talk about the hallway track and, maybe people are talking about the after party and things like that, but the whole range of different things going on, and, I&#8217;ve heard that same emotion, that same idea expressed by several people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s the thousands of little, small interactions that occur in unexpected places when you&#8217;re just wandering around the corridors that seem to make great big difference. You described a minute ago that you were not in a position at the beginning of your WordPress journey to go to the real events. And so obviously you were happy with the online events. Have you had any experiences more recently where you&#8217;ve become a little bit fatigued by those?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you still attend them with the same alacrity that you used to, or do you find yourself perhaps not attending as much because it&#8217;s become a little bit, how should we say, a little bit tired and it&#8217;s the same thing potentially over and over again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:35] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> Yeah. So I would say that in the last two years, I have attended one online event and it wasn&#8217;t any of the ones I organized. I was online for both WordFests, through both of them. But the only WordCamp event I attended was the one where my girls played, they did some music for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And part of it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve reached a spot where I do go to events purely to meet people. And it&#8217;s really a challenge online. But also you know, when you sit in front of your computer all day and then want to go to an event on a weekend that involves sitting in front of your computer, again, it doesn&#8217;t have the same change of life that going to an in-person event has. It&#8217;s just exhausting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, good point, and I&#8217;m sure one that many people can identify with. So we&#8217;re going to change gears a little bit, and we&#8217;re going to introduce a post that Cate wrote on the 23rd of March. It&#8217;s called return to in-person events, blue sky thinking. You can find it on the make.wordpress.org channel, but for simplicity sake, just go to the post associated with this and I&#8217;ll put the link in there, and you can find it from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the intention of this is you would like to offer up a brainstorming opportunity to people, so that in the future, we&#8217;ve got some fresh ideas about how WordCamps and other WordPress meetups and so on might look. And it&#8217;s kind of based on the fact that, according to people such as yourself, I know you&#8217;ve recently written a more recent posts, which again, I&#8217;ll link to in the show notes, but there&#8217;s a piece of linked in the article from Andrea Middleton, in which she emphasizes that we probably are different as a species for want of a better word. We have been changed entirely by the last couple of years. And so if that is the case and we&#8217;ve got different expectations and we&#8217;ve got different, maybe we&#8217;ve got different concerns about the kind of situations we&#8217;re willing to put ourselves in, then we need to rethink what a WordCamp might look like. We could put the old WordCamp back together, but perhaps this is a fantastic opportunity to rejig it a little bit. Have I summarize that correctly or did I miss the target or perhaps just left something out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:01] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> I am delighted to say that you got it pretty much exactly, like what we&#8217;re looking for. So the community team is made up of community organizers. And so we have our own reasons, I&#8217;m a meetup organizer, as well as part of the organizing team for WordCamp US. I know what&#8217;s keeping me from organizing WordCamps. We&#8217;re not doing a local WordCamp this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And our meetup hasn&#8217;t started meeting a person again, even though our community&#8217;s fairly healthy and low on COVID at the moment. So I know what my reasons are, but that&#8217;s very limiting, you know, we don&#8217;t want to operate off of just what we know. We want to open it up to hear what other people know too. The reason that I did two posts, the first one is a brainstorming post. If you&#8217;re an organizer and you have ideas on how to restart your event, or how do you know how somebody could restart their event, please put them down, even if you touch more on pain points than actual answers, we want to hear what you&#8217;re thinking and where you&#8217;re hurting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other post is purely for pain points and open to the entire community. Both posts have the same goal of getting more people talking about the topic. Cause we&#8217;re just, we&#8217;re so much richer together. The ideas that I have can be good ideas, but they&#8217;re still limited by my experience and my perception. Other people, and you can see from the list of answers, like there are no two answers that are the same on the posts so far. And it&#8217;s just great to see the directions people approach the question from, and the ideas that they throw out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> This I think is the first podcast episode that I&#8217;ve done for WP Tavern where there really is an actual call to action, because I think the nature of this episode is that we&#8217;re hoping, if anybody is thinking about running an event or they have an opinion on how events should be in the future, we are encouraging you to find the link in the show notes and go to Cate&#8217;s posts and give her some feedback, because as we&#8217;ve just both said, the world has changed and we want to take this opportunity. It&#8217;s almost like phoenix from the flames kind of thing. Isn&#8217;t it? You know, we&#8217;ve got this opportunity to revitalize and build from the ground up. Whilst you were talking just then I was going through in my mind some of the friends that I have in the real world and some of the differences that I&#8217;ve noticed in them over the last two years. And it may be in the case of some people that I know that they are now less likely to leave their own home. You know, they try to do everything in a much more confined way. They leave and try to achieve four things in one outing from the house, as opposed to one outing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have other friends who are just desperate everything, to return to normal and be able to throw all of the, all of the restrictions and everything over their shoulder and leave this whole thing behind. And there are other people who may be somewhere in the middle, you know, they&#8217;ve got a cautionary approach and some things they want to be mindful of and other things not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s with that opinion that we&#8217;re going into this, and you&#8217;ve got three goals. It would be silly if I said what they were, maybe it&#8217;s best if I hand that to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:52] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> Yeah we want the meetup organizers to feel supported, because we all know that even though we&#8217;re coming out of COVID, I&#8217;m exhausted. I mean I&#8217;ve been trying to keep a family safe. Running a business and all the other things that happen, you know, we&#8217;re all tired if nothing else. And so meetup organizers are, to ask them to do one more thing, we&#8217;re looking to ease that as best we can. But like you said, the people that we&#8217;re trying to help, they&#8217;re different. They&#8217;re reasonably scared. They&#8217;re nervous about being back out around people. Maybe they&#8217;ve got particular health reasons that make it more challenging. So we need to be supporting the organizers as well as the attendees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And hopefully through brainstorming with the community, which is the third point, we can come up with some new and creative ways to make this easier for everybody. But if we don&#8217;t like, if the organizers don&#8217;t feel supported and the attendees don&#8217;t feel safe, then nobody&#8217;s going to come back together again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The purpose of this is that you want ideas and let&#8217;s go through a few of the different ideas that we&#8217;ve had so far. The ideas are being shared in the form of comments at the bottom of the posts in a sort of typical WordPress fashion. Do you just want to go through a few of the pieces that you&#8217;ve picked up on that were quite interesting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the idea here is I guess to illustrate that, as you said, none of them are the same. Everybody seems to have a different expectation of what they would like to change. And some of them were really curious to me as I read through them. I genuinely thought that never would have occurred to me. So let&#8217;s just share, go through a few of those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:25] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> Sure. Yeah. You know, we&#8217;ve been talking more and more about diversity in the community and well, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily fit, it may not have been something we had on our mind when this post came out. Hearing other people talk about how adding diversity options to our meetups can help people feel more safe and comfortable, that definitely is right on topic. And so it wasn&#8217;t a direction we expected anybody to come from, but we&#8217;re really happy to get that feedback from them. Another post talks about reusing talks that have happened at other WordCamps or at other meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our meetup is small here in Grand Rapids, and we started before the pandemic bringing in virtual speakers because that, not that we didn&#8217;t have speakers who were willing, but it was kind of always the same people feeling like they had to speak. And so to bring more diversity, more variety to our topics, we started bringing in the virtual speakers and you can do that over prerecorded talk from somebody else or from a different WordCamp. And so those are the kinds of ideas, like looking at content that we already have, that we can reuse. I&#8217;m talking about, what resources can we provide if they can make this easier for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, you mentioned diversity. Somebody mentioned the idea that maybe going forwards, it would be a good idea to not have a single individual in charge of any event no matter how small or large it might be. The idea of teaming up with people, that speaks very much to the, you know, you&#8217;ve said earlier that you were exhausted off the back of this, maybe spreading that load slightly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how don&#8217;t know how easy that is I&#8217;m not entirely sure what the sense of wishing to be an organizer is these days. I don&#8217;t know if the desire to organize these kinds of events has gone down because of the pandemic or there&#8217;s more people trying to get involved in there, but I do also like the idea of the one that you just shared in terms of people reusing content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That just strikes me as such a sensible idea. If somebody over in on Australian meetup has created a piece of content and it&#8217;s already there and it&#8217;s perfectly usable. In fact, it might be utterly brilliant. Why not just repurpose it and have it say in Birmingham or Manchester or Los Angeles or wherever it might be. And in that way, we can share that content rather than it being viewed by the 40 people who showed up to that event on that particular date and time. That&#8217;s a really powerful one I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:43] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> Yeah, exactly. The initial one you shared goes back to something that you mentioned earlier, but we&#8217;re really looking at rethinking how meetups are structured. And in reality, I think it&#8217;s more of a communicating with the community about how meetups are intended to be structured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They aren&#8217;t necessarily supposed to have a single organizer. They&#8217;ve kind of fallen into, I don&#8217;t want to say a rut, but kind of a pattern of you have a meetup and it has a speaker and you know, and that&#8217;s what that month is like. When in reality any person in the meetup can organize an event that can just be coffee or coworking. And so we have plans in the works to start reminding people that there are other alternatives to what a meetup can look like or who can organize an event. And we&#8217;re hoping that will help with growing co-organizers, which is another response on the post as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then also move into the idea of repurposing content or like using some of the new Learn content that&#8217;s been coming out, that&#8217;s structured nicely for meetups, but just getting some new ideas on what a meetup needs to look like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There seems to be a concern in some of them, although it&#8217;s not explicitly stated, it&#8217;s kind of implied in a few of the comments that you&#8217;ve got, that there&#8217;s concern around the size of the audience and the size of the pool of people who are going to be willing to do events in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I just wonder, do you have concerns about that? Do you have concerns that in the future, these events are going to reopen only to find that less people are getting there. If that&#8217;s the case, and that is something we need to worry about because people have got into the habit of not attending, or maybe they&#8217;re just new to the community over the last couple of years, and they simply don&#8217;t know that these things ever existed. And if that&#8217;s the case, how do we find them? How do we tell them that these events are going on? And there&#8217;s a, there&#8217;s a few answers to that in there as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:32] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> That&#8217;s a great point. That&#8217;s a great kind of side effect to come out of the post, is seeing what those additional concerns are. You know, maybe it&#8217;s not as focused around content for their meetup, but how do you get people involved? And so those are areas that we can continue to address as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s important to remember that it&#8217;s not a contest. If you&#8217;ve got three people who have gathered to learn, then that&#8217;s two people that didn&#8217;t gather before. And it doesn&#8217;t have to be big to be successful. Growing a community can start in a lot of little ways that you know, if you&#8217;re helping the people that want to be helped, that&#8217;s what matters most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also starting to look at what our community looks like because as more people go online with their jobs as they look at career transitions and now is a huge time for career transitions. You&#8217;ve got younger people coming in, but you&#8217;ve also got older people coming in. My parents&#8217; generation who are retiring, but have computer skills and are excited about starting their next business or, you know, their third business. It&#8217;s important to think about your community, the makeup of it in different ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that was another one that came out which I found quite curious. This idea that it would be a good opportunity to attract age groups at the end of the spectrum at both ends. So a great opportunity to reach out to new people who probably don&#8217;t really know too much about these WordPress events. Maybe they&#8217;re students and they&#8217;re fresh out of college.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this would be a great moment to get them involved. And maybe not only will they become part of the community, but they might wish to take on some of the responsibility for organizing events like this, but also, and this really hadn&#8217;t occurred to me, forgive my ignorance here, the older end of the spectrum, the idea that there&#8217;s probably a lot of people out there who would welcome an event as friendly and as interesting as a WordCamp and tapping into that resource as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:25] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> Yeah, one of the problems that we had specifically in our meetup is we were all kind of the same age, and Topher and I of course had children kind of early for nowadays. But as our friends were starting to have their children, it gets hard to balance family and meetup and job, and all the other responsibilities that you have. So having a meetup group that is made up of a variety of different ages and life points, or, you know, places where you are in your life, can be really useful to you because you do have those people who are young and enthusiastic or are established and, and reliable, or, you know, young and reliable established, and enthusiastic. However you want to look at it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole community benefits from having people who are at different stages of their life. I know for me, I&#8217;ve actually had more experience meeting people and maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m a little bit older, but meeting people who are on their second stage journey and are embracing WordPress for all that it has to offer. They have a little more disposable income. They have a little more life experience, and they&#8217;re often excited to be starting something new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess it was obvious that some people were going to put comments in about COVID itself and the restrictions around that, and that&#8217;s going to be a big concern for people in terms of, what will the restrictions be? What will the regulations be? Masking perhaps, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And somebody mentioned, and I hadn&#8217;t come across this idea, but they mentioned that this is happening in other real world events that people are wearing what we in the UK called badges, but I believe you called buttons, a little visual emblem to show some sort of status in terms of what you would like people, how you would like people&#8217;s behavior to be toward you, perhaps social distancing. You&#8217;re wearing a yellow or an orange badge or something, and that, the implication of that is I need to be kept away from, I would like that to be a distance between me and other people. I found that really interesting as well, ways to assuage people&#8217;s fear about COVID. So anything like that, they could get in touch with you and say as well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:26] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. And something we&#8217;re looking at, particularly as we go into WordCamp US. From a personal level, I love this idea. Whether it&#8217;s during a pandemic or just any regular event. I grew up Midwestern here in the U S and hugging was never not an option, like, you just hugged everybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like that&#8217;s what you did. And so it&#8217;s actually been kind of a revelation for me that you don&#8217;t have to hug everybody. And kind of freeing kind of strange to say at 45. Not everybody likes to be touched the same way. Not everybody wants to seem interaction. And so to be more, yes, it&#8217;s coming out of the pandemic, but I think it&#8217;s a good thing to come out of the pandemic where we can, just like we&#8217;re embracing people&#8217;s pronouns, we can embrace their space restrictions as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We had a podcast episode several weeks ago with some people off the WordCamp Europe team. And they had gone to great lengths. We didn&#8217;t really get into the subject of how they had arrived at the decisions, which is basically what we&#8217;re talking about today. We&#8217;re providing, or you are Cate providing a, how we can do things in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was more of an explanation of just what is happening at WordCamp Europe. And that didn&#8217;t come up in our conversation, but it was pretty clear that they&#8217;d gone to great lengths to figure out how they could make it as safe as possible. So masks at all times, testing available and all the eating and the dining and all of that. The socializing is going to be outside and it&#8217;s happens to be in Portugal, so the weather is going to be fairly predictable and reliable. So that&#8217;s kind of good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the fact is all of this needed to be thought about, and we can inject more thoughts if we come along and contribute to your post. You called it blue sky thinking are you really going for that? Is it literally just throw any idea at us and let&#8217;s see? Obviously there&#8217;s constraints about being ridiculous or possibly, you know, rude or what have you but, you&#8217;re just after anything. Give us any ideas, let&#8217;s see. Maybe there&#8217;s a gem in there. There&#8217;s a needle in a haystack that we hadn&#8217;t thought about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:27] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> Yeah. You know, that&#8217;s exactly it. So yes, it&#8217;s a blue sky thinking. Can we act and actually implement every idea that comes across from the post? No, we can&#8217;t do that. We can&#8217;t give everybody a safety bubble that they can wear at each camp. That would be super fun, but it&#8217;s not going to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can&#8217;t make it perfect for everybody, but you never know what part of an idea might come out of a suggestion that was made that seemed completely farfetched. That is actually revolutionary, and it changes how we all operate. So we don&#8217;t want to put limits on people. You have to be friendly. You have to be polite to the people around you, but beyond that, we really want to hear your ideas. If you think that it would be useful to a meetup or a WordCamp organizer, let us hear about it because, who knows?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Coincidentally. Maybe it wasn&#8217;t. So coincidentally, I don&#8217;t know. But similar time, Josepha Hayen Chomphosy, who&#8217;s the executive director of the WordPress project. She put out a podcast episode on her WP Briefing podcast. Again, I&#8217;ll link to that in the show notes, where she illustrated that there are now some mandatory guidelines, Anybody wanting to organize an event over 50 people, basically it can be the local guidelines. If there&#8217;s any extra guidelines on top of the WordPress guidelines, you&#8217;ve got to follow all of those. And in some cases it might be that you may need to do testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in which case, if you&#8217;re doing testing, you have to make sure that there&#8217;s boots on the ground and staff available to make that happen. There&#8217;s a little bit more to it than that. It&#8217;s a little bit more complicated, but I just wondered if, in the future, you had any thoughts on whether these events are going to be more complicated to organize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so whilst we&#8217;ve got the blue sky thinking on the one hand, on the other hand, we have the difficult reality that we have to actually manage this stuff and not everything can be lovely. Some of it is going to be a slog. Some of it&#8217;s going to be difficult to implement. And in some cases it might be disappointing because you may get to the point where you are days away from having an event and the guidelines change locally, you have to pull it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I guess we&#8217;ve got to be just a bit mindful haven&#8217;t we? Over on the one side, it&#8217;s all roses and the sun is shining and then possibly on the other hand, there is a slightly more gloomy side that we probably should talk about briefly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:47] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> Yeah. I think it&#8217;s really important. I mean, this happened to WordCamp Birmingham and our restrictions don&#8217;t match their local restrictions. And it&#8217;s been a challenge for them. They haven&#8217;t been able to restart planning their WordCamp until the current WordPress COVID guidelines change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s something that is in talks. You know, we know that it will be flexible in that they will change again in the future. But we&#8217;re also being cautious. When you have a huge global community with people who range from incredibly healthy to potentially invalids at home, you have to really measure what inclusivity looks like and try to hit kind of a middle point where people feel reasonably safe, organizers feel reasonably supported, but it also realistically fits what a group can manage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s a very difficult balance to try to find. One of the, one of our biggest concerns and one reasons that we&#8217;ve erred on the side of being a little more conservative, a little bit more strict with our guidelines is we don&#8217;t ever want an organizer to feel responsible for the health of their community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we&#8217;re trying to take that burden kind of on ourselves so that when an organizer acts they&#8217;re acting because that&#8217;s what WordCamp Central told them to do. Any errors on the side of a healthier community instead of a together community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned at the start that you obviously want everybody to get involved in your post. And again, once again, I&#8217;ll just illustrate that the post is available at the make dot wordpress dot org site. And once again, I&#8217;ll say that the links are in the show notes. More broadly if somebody has listened to this and just thought, oh boy, I really quite like to get involved in some of these events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have any pointers, any guidance for people? Where would be their first port of call if they wish to involved in a local meetup or a more global meetup. Where would you point people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:48] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> Sure. If you&#8217;re looking to get involved, you can go to meetup.com and search for WordPress, and you&#8217;ll find all of the ones that are in your area. You can also find all of the ones and most of them still have a virtual element, so you can get involved in meetups across the world, which is kind of a really great thing that came out of the pandemic, is a huge opportunity for, you know, all of those barriers to go away and to really grow the global community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It did make it a little more challenging, to grow the local communities, but the global ones are easier. If you&#8217;re looking to actually organize, you can head over to wordpress.org and there are a variety of handbooks. You can search for, you know, meetup organizer or a WordCamp organizer, and look through the handbook and see what&#8217;s just involved in organizing these different events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Cate on a personal level, what&#8217;s the best way that people could communicate with you, should they have listened to this and think, actually I want to go straight to Cate. That could be email or Twitter or whatever you feel most comfortable with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:45] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> I&#8217;m on Twitter, at my sweet Cate and that&#8217;s Cate with a C because it is. So you can also find me on Twitter at my sweet Cate. I am on LinkedIn. I rarely Facebook, so that&#8217;s really not a good place to find me. If you want to send me an email, Cate at HeroPress dot com is a good one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m always really happy to hear from the community. You know, if you&#8217;ve got a question, I always try to answer it because there&#8217;s nothing like trying to find information and having somebody just ghost you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I hope that this podcast episode has managed to get people to go and offer some blue sky thoughts. It will be open for the next few days. I&#8217;m not a hundred percent sure exactly how many days between the date this podcast goes out and when you&#8217;re going to be really gathering up those comments and examining them, but they&#8217;ll certainly be a period of time after this podcast comes out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s hope that this podcast prompts a few people to wander over there and give you their comments. Okay Cate, thank you so much for talking to me today on the podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:40] <strong>Cate DeRosia:</strong> Hey, thanks, Nathan. I really appreciate you giving us a platform to talk about this, to help get people feeling more comfortable and safe and heard. Cause they really matter to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You are most welcome.
