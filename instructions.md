The Challenge

Part I: Use WordPress as a Headless CMS.

You will be using WordPress mainly as a back-end resource to store all your data, you’ll take full advantage of creating Custom Post types to organize your data types and Advanced Custom Fields to enrich the data that will be later consumed through the WordPress API by your front-end.

Requirements:

Setting up a local development environment for your WordPress installation.
Create the following custom post type: Podcast.
Refer to the UI design to judge the Advanced Custom Fields that you will use inside this custom post type.
Cerate Blog posts.
Create a “gallery” Advanced Custom Field for pages.
Use Contact Form 7 to submit forms.
Create an Advanced custom field to customize the Hero section.
The source code must be a GitHub repository publicly available containing the WordPress files + database.
The repository should include a README file with all documentation necessary to run the project locally.


Extra Points (Nice to have but not required):

Write your Custom post types manually, not using a plugin.
Write your ACF Fields manually, not using the UI creator.
Have an organized folder structure for your custom post types PHP files.
Deploy your WordPress on any cloud provider or hosting platform.
Make the assets the smallest possible size - ensure that images are properly optimized, resources minified,
